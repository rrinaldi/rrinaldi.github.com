<p>I certainly don't.&nbsp; Most of the time.</p> <p>Lately I've been <a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan/archive/2006/08/14/12087.aspx">spending time</a>&nbsp;working with Team Build to automate the builds of a few of our applications and I've discovered that way too many apps deploy themselves into the GAC.&nbsp; Discovered isn't the right word, I've known for awhile that all of our 3rd party controls go into the GAC, but I didn't realize how big of a pain it was going to be.</p> <p>In my not-so-humble opinion, if you aren't creating a framework of some sort that is going to be versioned fairly slowly (I'm talking 1 1/2 to 2 year dev cycles) don't be putting yourself in the GAC.&nbsp; Controls that update themselves monthly are not candidates to be installed in the GAC.&nbsp; They are just to volatile.&nbsp; Also, my build server is&nbsp;going to be&nbsp;building various web apps, some windows services, and a winforms app or two.&nbsp; I don't want to be constantly installing software onto that machine.&nbsp; </p> <p>Another issue of having every Tom, Dick, and Harry install things into the GAC is it now makes it more difficult for me get another developer up and running.&nbsp; Instead of a simple "Get the latest code from this branch of the Acme Project" it turns into a "Get the latest, install Xyz Corps MegaControls package, then install Abc Systems SimpleGrid Plus, then install...".&nbsp; Let me drop all of the references I need in a directory that is in source control and the new developer is up and running and building in a couple minutes.&nbsp; Otherwise he will be burning a day or more installing software.</p>
