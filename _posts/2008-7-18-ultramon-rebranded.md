At the office I have multiple monitors and I downloaded the king of all
multiple monitor utilities UltraMon.  Today while surfing I stumbled
across [Digital Tigers](http://www.digitaltigers.com/index.shtml), a
company that markets multiple monitors that are hooked up to appear as
one monitor.  While surfing the site, I found this: [TigerVista
Manager](http://www.digitaltigers.com/tigervista_manager.shtml), which
is nothing more the a rebranding of UltraMon!   Take a look at [this
site](http://www.realtimesoft.com/ultramon/tour/) and you'll see that
they are completely identical.  It's cool and all if UltraMon sold
Digital Tigers the software, but on the Digital Tigers site they
proclaim that TigerVista Manager is exclusive software and only
available direct from them. :(
