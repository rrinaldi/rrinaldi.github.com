DSL.</font></p> <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Here are some wonderfully ignorant statements:</font></p> <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comparing Windows to a new car-</font></p> <blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"> <p><font face="Arial" size="2">"Here is your brand new car, sir. Drive it off the lot. Yay yay new car. Suddenly, new car shuts off. New car barely starts again and then only goes about 6 miles per hour and it belches smoke and every warning light on the dashboard is blinking on and off and the tires are screaming and the heater is blasting your feet and something smells like burned hair. You hobble back to the dealer, who only says, gosh, sorry, we thought you knew -- that's they way they <i>all</i> run. Enjoy! "</font></p></blockquote> <p dir="ltr"><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Actually, if you want to</font> <font face="Arial">use that analogy it should read something like this:</font></font></p> <blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"> <p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="2">"Here is your brand new car, sir. Drive it off the lot.&nbsp; Yay yay new car. Suddenly, 7000 people come rushing out of nowhere and start pelting your car with bricks, beating it with bats, and try to pry the hood open with a crowbar.&nbsp; None of them are very effective however.&nbsp; But this man came walking up, asked if he could install a new radio and now the car is filled with cement and on fire.&nbsp; You go back to the dealer, and the dealer asked why you would let a strange man into your car to&nbsp;install a new radio?&nbsp; You answer 'because he asked, and I wanted it for free.' At that point the car dealer explains that the car was doing a perfectly good job of protecting you from harm, but it can't protect you from yourself."</font></p></blockquote> <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Here is another one:</font></p> <blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"> <p><font face="Arial" size="2">"I know of what I speak. I am not a novice. I've been using Macs almost daily for 15 years. I am online upward of 10-12 hours a day. I run multiple Net-connected programs at all times. I receive upward of 500 emails a day, much of it nasty spam that often comes with weird indecipherable attachments that try, in vain, to infiltrate my machine. My Mac just shrugs them off and keeps working perfectly. I dump them all in the trash and never look back."</font></p></blockquote> <p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="2">Could it be that, GASP, the viruses that your Mac simply shrugged off weren't written to run on a Mac?&nbsp; Gosh, golly, gee that couldn't be right.&nbsp; It must be the fact that the Mac is such a FAR superior machine!&nbsp; Two words: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=googlet&amp;q=Occam%27s%20Razor">Occam's Razor</a>.</font></p> <p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="2">Oh, oh! Here is a statement that contradicts itself!</font></p> <blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"> <p dir="ltr"><font size="2"><font face="Arial">"Which is, of course, mostly bull. I'm no programmer, but I know what I read, and I know my experience: the Mac OS architecture is much more robust, much more solid, much more difficult to hack into. Apple's software is, by default, more sound and reliable, given its more stable core. (Sometime in the later '90s, a Mac org whose name I forget ran a rather</font> <a href="http://db.tidbits.com/getbits.acgi?tbart=02166"><font face="Arial">amazing hacker competition</font></a><font face="Arial">: they offered a $13,000 cash prize to anyone in the world who could hack into the company's unprotected Mac server and alter the contest's home page in any way. Needless to say, no one ever could). "</font></font></p></blockquote> <p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="2">So the Mac OS architecture is robust, and solid, and more difficult to hack into?&nbsp; Then why did Apple drop the OS that was so hack proof?&nbsp; Oh, you didn't realize that the hacking competition that you reference was in 1997 and on a machine that can't support OS 10?&nbsp; The latest OS from Apple?&nbsp; The one that is currently on machines?&nbsp; The one you are comparing to Window XP?</font></p> <p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial"><font size="2">Grrr.....look, I can take criticism of Windows.&nbsp; I just can't listen to close minded zealotry of a platform.&nbsp; There are reasons to use Apple, there are reasons to use Windows, and there are reasons to use Linux.&nbsp; Learn the reasons, and choose a platform.&nbsp; Different strokes for different folks.</font></font></p> <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
