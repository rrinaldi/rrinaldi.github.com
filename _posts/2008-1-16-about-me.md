**Work:**\
 I'm a Software Architect at Trading Technologies on their Enterprise
Development team.  Most of my work is spent writing internal line of
business applications with the occasional work on internal tooling.  I'm
a big fan of writing/creating developer tools and decreasing developer
friction.
