After a scare, we are back up and running!&nbsp; I really need to thank Brian for coming through with a server to host the dojo!<BR><BR>As soon as things get settled, there will be a few changes around here. First of all, now that the Geekdojo has a second lease on life, I'm not going to take it for granted.&nbsp; Maybe it's because of the new year or because I almost had my "voice on the internet" taken away from me, but I'll try my best to post more often.&nbsp; When I think back and realize that three years ago we started this humble site I had a pretty powerful voice in the .NET development community and for some reason or another I've let that slide.&nbsp; I'm resolving to try to change that.&nbsp; There are a lot more voices out there now then there were three years ago, but my opinion is as valid as the next and by God I'll be out there shouting it! :)<BR><BR>Second, I'm sorry to say, is that I'm going to be putting up more Google Ads.&nbsp; I wish I didn't have to, but now that the site is being hosted on server that a friend is shelling out good money for I feel that it is a necessity.&nbsp; If there are any problems with that, or you have a better idea on how to try to generate revenue to cover our costs let me know.<BR><BR>Thanks again Brian!&nbsp; You've truly blessed us and it is greatly appreciated!
