<p>Noticed today that <a href="http://microsoftgadgets.com/">Microsoftgadgets.com</a>&nbsp;was updated!&nbsp; After taking a spin around the site I noticed a post from Jeff Sandquist making the <a href="http://www.jeffsandquist.com/WhyAreMyEyesBloodshot.aspx">&lsquo;official&rsquo; announcement</a>.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s a shame that microsoftgadgets.com is being trolled by Mac fan-boys that can do nothing better than rehash the same arguments: 1.) &ldquo;Apple had gadgets in the 1980s with the introduction of the Lisa!!!&rdquo; or the often repeated phrase 2.) &ldquo;Redmond, start your copiers!&rdquo;. </p> <p>*sigh*&nbsp; Maybe I&rsquo;ll go into why both of these statements are completely braindead at a later date.</p>
