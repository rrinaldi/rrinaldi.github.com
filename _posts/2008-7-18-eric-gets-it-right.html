<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="http://software.ericsink.com/entries/vsts_pricing.html">Eric Sink is one smart mother</a>.&nbsp; With all of the <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2005/03/22/395502.aspx">complaining</a>, <a href="http://scrappydog.com/blog/archive/2005/03/21/1412.aspx">bitching</a>, and moaning about not getting Team System for free, Eric is the first person I saw that pointed out that you really don't get anything for "free" with MSDN.&nbsp; All that software you get is so you can develop against it, not that you can use it how please because you happen to be a developer.&nbsp; Let me explain:</font></p> <p><font face="Arial" size="2">MSDN gives you software and the right to use that software when you are developing applications that interoperate with the software from MSDN (Holy Recursiveness Batman!).&nbsp; Make sense?&nbsp; MSDN does not give you rights to use Office, if you aren't using Office in your application.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see why this is confusing, so&nbsp;let me try&nbsp;explaining with a really, really bad analogy:</font></p> <blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"> <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You build cabinets.&nbsp; I build houses.&nbsp; I depend on you to build quality cabinets so people will buy my houses, so I give you a "Development House".&nbsp; You can go in to this house and put up cabinets, take them down, figure out the best way to install them, and so on.&nbsp; Since I gave you the house so you can test install cabinets in it, I would be mightily pissed if you moved your family in.</font></p></blockquote> <p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="2">Get it?&nbsp; (I told you it was bad (I'm really sorry you had to sit through it)).&nbsp; Eric does a better job of explaining that then I do, so go read his post.</font></p> <p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="2">Eric also brings up the issue of tiers, and how MS is pricing Team System for the "Team" tier to go after the&nbsp;people they lose to Rational/IBM.&nbsp; That still leaves the question as to why they left the "Professional" tier alone.&nbsp; I think that answer is pretty apparent:Microsoft can't compete at the 5 - 100 developer level.</font><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;Think about it for a second.&nbsp; With tools like <a href="http://www.testdriven.net/Default.aspx?ReferrerId=3937">TestDriven.NET</a>, <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">SubVersion</a>, <a href="http://ccnet.thoughtworks.com/">CruiseControl.NET</a>, and the large amount of free/inexpensive quality defect tracking out there they can't compete.&nbsp; Wherever they price themselves, they price themselves out of the market.</font></p> <p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="2">I completely understand where everybody is coming from. "Team System is the new hotness and gosh darn it I want it."&nbsp; I want it too!&nbsp; Team System&nbsp;gives me "Shiny Thing Syndrome".&nbsp; It's cool, it's slick, it's all that and a bag of chips. (I should be a Team System cheerleader).&nbsp;&nbsp;But you know,&nbsp;I&nbsp;also want a Lamborghini and I'm sure a whole bunch of you wouldn't mind one either.&nbsp; The thing is, it isn't in my price range.&nbsp; Neither is Team System.&nbsp; I don't think I will be getting either any time soon.</font></p>
