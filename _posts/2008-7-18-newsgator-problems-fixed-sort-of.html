<p>After spending an inordinate amount of time with Ronnie from NewsGator I was able to find the cause of my NewsGator woes.&nbsp; It seems that the Getting Things Done! add-in for Outlook and NewsGator were conflicting with each other.&nbsp; I disabled the GTD add-in for a little while so I could run NewsGator, but I shortly learned that I was dependent on the add-in more than I originally thought I was.&nbsp; </p> <p>So I had to un-install NewsGator.&nbsp; I then started a hunt for a new aggregator.&nbsp; I tried FeedDemon, but I got a little frustrated because it didn't have Search folders.&nbsp; With NewsGator I just fired up Outlook and clicked on the Unread Mail search folder and pretty much lived in there for the day.&nbsp; All of my feeds and all of my mail wound up in that folder for me to ponder on no matter where my rules might have actually placed the emails.&nbsp; I LOVE the search folders.&nbsp; </p> <p>Anywho, I then un-installed FeedDemon and moved to <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/omea/reader/">Omea</a> from <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains</a>.&nbsp; Seemed to be a pretty cool app.&nbsp; The install went well and I used it for a couple days and loved, loved, LOVED the fact that it had search folders.&nbsp; I eventually had to un-install it though. </p> <p>My reason?&nbsp; It allowed me to group my unread mail, but it had very odd grouping logic.&nbsp; I could group on 10 or so different items, but the one I really wanted to group on was "Weblog".&nbsp; I couldn't.&nbsp; I could only group on "Author/Weblog", and that seemed to group on Author if it was present, but group on Weblog if it isn't.&nbsp; Problem being I read a lot of "Group" blogs, like Engadget and Slashdot.&nbsp; Those sites might have 10 different authors.&nbsp; My problem is I don't care.&nbsp; I want them to be a group under the weblog name.&nbsp; Omea was trying to be too clever.&nbsp; and I un-installed it because of that cleverness.</p> <p>Right now I'm using <a href="http://www.attensa.com/index.php">Attensa</a>.&nbsp; Seems pretty good.&nbsp; I'm happy that it's back in Outlook and I can have my wonderful search folders.&nbsp; I like that if somebody doesn't provide full-text feeds I can set it up to download the page the feed links to and show me that instead.&nbsp; Which is kind of a win/win for everybody.&nbsp; I still get full-text and the author of the blog gets to show his advertisers one more hit. (Not like my pair of eyes is going to be generating that much revenue, but whatever).&nbsp; Might be a feature that NewsGator should consider.&nbsp; I'm hoping that NewsGator can fix whatever is making it go "Boom!" on my machine, because I miss it.&nbsp; Attensa is cool so far, but NewsGator had a "spit and polish" that I liked.&nbsp; Attensa is still a little rough around the edges.</p>
