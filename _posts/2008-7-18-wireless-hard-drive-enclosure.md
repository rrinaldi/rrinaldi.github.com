I’m a guy without a desktop.  At home I only use laptops, which is great
and all but it comes with a couple downsides.  One of those downsides is
that the collection of old hard drives that I have has been almost
completely useless.  I know I could use a external enclosure but that is
pretty pointless when I have my laptops so I can roam around my
apartment unencumbered by cords and accessories.  For people like me,
DLink has come out with an [external hard drive enclosure that runs over
a wireless network!](http://www.dlink.com/products/?sec=0&pid=377)  This
is great!  Not only can it be used as an enclosure but it also allows
you to add up to two USB 2.0/1.1 drives for more storage and can be used
as a wireless access point.  This is going on my list of things to buy.
