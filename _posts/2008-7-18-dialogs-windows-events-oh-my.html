<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">Anytime you give a user a list of items to choose from there is always going to be the problem of what to do when the item the user wants is not in that list (dropdown, select box, what-have-you).  You normally have two options that you can implement. 1.) Have the user leave the page and enter the item they want in the item creation page.  2.) Allow the user to open up a dialog and create the item right there.  Both of these options leave little to be desired.  For instance take the first option, have the user navigate to the item creation page and enter the data there.  That’s all fine and dandy, except all the work the user has done on the page up to that point is now lost.  Not a very good user experience there, now is it?  Now take the second option, let the user pop open a dialog screen to enter the data.  At first glance, that ’s great since now the user hasn’t lost any work, and the item has been created.  But now how do you update the original page with the newly created item?  If you have the dialog simply call a opener.location.reload(); when it’s done with its work you run into the same problem of the first option.  All the work that the user has done up to that point is now gone.  You can’t have the dialog window just close, because then the information that the user is looking at hasn’t been updated.  What you (and I) need is some sort of event that we can capture that tells us the dialog is done with its work and we can reload the item list.  Well, today I created just that.  </font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">First let’s create some method that we can call when the dialog is done doing its dirty work.</font></p> <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">protected virtual void PageComplete(string args)<br />  {<br />   if( Request.QueryString["targetMethod"] != null)<br />   {<br />    string script = @"window.opener." + Request.QueryString["targetMethod"] + "(window, " + args + ");";<br />    Page.RegisterStartupScript("_clientEventHandler", "&lt;script&gt;" + script + "&lt;/script&gt;");<br />   }<br />  }</font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">The method is pretty simple.  Check to see if a targetMethod is present in the request collection.  If targetMethod exists, lets output some JavaScript that will call that method on the dialog window opener.</font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">The second thing we need to know is how to call the dialog so that we will get a callback from the window when it’s done.  This is SO simple, but I figure I’ll give an example just in case someone out there needs it.</font></p> <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">http://..../dialogWindow.aspx?targetMethod=dialogEventHandler</font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">So now that the dialog window is going to call a method on the opener window, we need to write one.</font></p> <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">function dialogEventHandler(sender, args) <br />{ <br />    var target = document.getElementById("&lt;%= buttonToClick.ClientID %&gt;"); <br />    target.click(); <br />    if( sender != null) <br />    { <br />        sender.close(); <br />    } <br />}</font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">As you can see, this function takes in 2 arguments very similar to an event handler in .NET.  The first argument is a reference to the window that called the function (the dialog window), and the second argument is going to be populated with any arguments that you might want to pass from the dialog window to the function (in our case, it was obvious that we wanted to get the newly created items ID so we could select it automagically for the user).  </font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">The last thing you’ll need to setup is something that you can trigger client side that will cause an event to be fired server side.  My preferred method is to create a button on the page and then hide it using styles.</font></p> <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;INPUT id=buttonToClick style="DISPLAY: none" type=button&gt;</font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">I find this a pretty easy, yet powerful way to manage dialog windows.  </font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">If you find this useful in any way, let me know!<br /></font></p>
