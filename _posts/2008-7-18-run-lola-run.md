Friday I sat down and watched “[Run Lola
Run](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130827/)”, a great flick if enjoy
watching people play with time. :) The plot is outlined simply as “Lola
runs. To save her boyfriend's life.“

I know I'm late to the party, seeing how this movie was released in
1998, but if you like foreign films with a sweet techno/trance
soundtrack take some time and watch it.  It won't take long since the
movie is only 80 minutes.

FYI: Don't watch this movie if you don't like subtitles or voice
dubbing.  Also, don't watch it if you don't want to think.  It doesn't
make you think like the Matrix does, but it will at least make you say
“huh?”.
