At work I have 2 monitors and my trusty laptop
[MojoDojo](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan/archive/2005/03/24/7538.aspx) playing
the part of the 3rd monitor.  I’ve been using
[MaxiVista](http://www.maxivista.com/) to pull of this feat for quite
awhile now.  The cool thing is that the mother of all extendo-monitor
apps is [now at version 2](http://www.maxivista.com/new.htm).  Adding a
wonderful, splendiforous feature: Remote Control.  Now with the flick of
the Scroll Lock key (configurable if you happen to be using scroll lock
for something else), I can remote control my laptop and then with a
flick back it becomes a 3rd monitor.  I love it!  When I need to drag
something over there and I’m craving a little more screen real estate, I
make my laptop a monitor.  Otherwise, I have it churning and burning
away as a Command and Control center for all of my communications apps
(Outlook, MSN, Trillian (Yes, I run MSN and Trillian.  Trillian for my
buddies and MSN for work, so I can have all the wonderful app sharing,
white-boarding goodness)).  When an email pops up, I just move my cursor
off of my one machine and right onto my other. My work box need not spin
it’s cycles checking exchange any longer! Oh, did I mention that it can
remote control up to 3 other PCs, and it syncs the clipboard?  Yeah,
MaxiVista rocks that much harder than it used to.
