Looks like the registration slipped for the Dojo!  Sorry about that! 
All seems to be back to normal again. (At least DNS seems to have
propagated correctly to the South Loop in Chicago)

As an FYI to all y'all, if I have a few spare cycles this weekend, I'll
be upgrading the dojo yet again but this time it will be to CS 2.1.
