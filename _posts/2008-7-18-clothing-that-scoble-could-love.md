On a complete lark, [Richard](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/richard/),
[Ray](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/jez/) and I decided that we should
[create a line of clothing](http://www.cafeshops.com/blogfromit) that
would be perfect for the center of the blogoshere himself,
[Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/).Â  Our design skills are
weak, and we threw everything together in a matter of minutes but I
think we created a great line for him (and maybe something for the
[Misses](http://www.cafeshops.com/blogfromit.10870913)).
