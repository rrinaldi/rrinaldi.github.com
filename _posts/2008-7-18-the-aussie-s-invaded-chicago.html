<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=1>Please indulge my voyage into music journalism. :)</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>The Aussie Tour.&nbsp; Don't know if that was the official name, but it's what the girlfriend and I were referring to it as.&nbsp; Last night I saw <EM>The Living End</EM>, <EM>Jet</EM> and <EM>The Vines</EM> at the Vic in Chicago.&nbsp; Wonderful show.&nbsp; I never heard of <EM>The Living End</EM> before, but after last night I am definitely a fan.&nbsp; They put on a very energetic show and I was finding myself upset at the audience for not giving them anything back.&nbsp; They call their brand of music "Punk-a-billy" and after talking with another concert goer, we came to the conclusion that <EM>The Living End</EM> is a cross between <EM>AC/DC</EM>, the <EM>Stray Cats</EM> and some <EM>Offspring</EM> style punk.&nbsp; I'm going to head out a little latter to pick up their album and I suggest you do the same. :)</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2><EM>Jet'</EM>s performance was spectacular, so much so it may have even been a little over the top.&nbsp; The Vic is a great little venue for a concert.&nbsp; Emphasis on little.&nbsp; <EM>Jet</EM>'s performance would have been great for, oh I don't know, the United center, Soldier field, or, hell, even a huge ass concert on the moon so it can be seen from space.&nbsp; Lot's of spot lights, strobes and smoke machines.&nbsp; Would make any arena rock band proud.&nbsp; I was a little disappointed that, due to time constraints, they weren't able to play any of their slower songs.&nbsp; [If you only have have heard <EM>Jet</EM>'s singles on the radio you would label them a rock/punk band [I am really bad at figuring out genre's for bands, so don't yell at me.&nbsp; All I know is what I like.] but if you listen to their album you'll soon find out that they seem to have a heavy <EM>Beatles</EM>/John Lennon influence.&nbsp; Go pick up the album, or at the very least go listen to it at some record store.]</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I hope I don't offend anyone by saying this, but <EM>The Vines</EM> lead singer is a pompous, arrogant prick.&nbsp; His bass player was visibly ticked at him and his drummer seemed bored out his mind.&nbsp; I would be too if I was playing music I hated.&nbsp; Apparently, the lead singer thought it would be cute to perform all of <EM>The Vines</EM> stuff in the style of <EM>Radiohead</EM>.&nbsp; I wasn't the only person upset with this as most of the audience booed and half walked out completely.&nbsp; It's not very often that you get to watch a venue empty out when the headliner comes on stage.&nbsp; They finally came around toward the end of the set.&nbsp; They played 3 or 4 songs that were actually quite enjoyable.</FONT></P>
