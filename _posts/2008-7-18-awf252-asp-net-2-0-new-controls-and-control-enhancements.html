<DIV>To be completely honest with you I have don't have very high hopes for this one. :(&nbsp; My notes will only cover things that I haven't already heard about.</DIV><DIV><HR></DIV><DIV>Grrr... Five minutes into the session and Bill Evjen is still introducing himself.&nbsp; Get to the code already! ( I know, INETA founder, wrote 10 books, yada yada yada)</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>This looks like it will be very light on the power point and heavy on code examples, which makes me quite happy.&nbsp; That kinda equates to less notes though, because I have a tendency to look up more and watch the screen instead of just listening to what the presenter is saying so this post will probably be a little light.&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Oh you probably have also noticed that spelling and grammar are terrible for the last couple posts.&nbsp; That's because I'm writing as fast and furiously as I can so I can try to keep up with the speaker.</DIV><DIV><HR></DIV><DIV>The new controls are better organized in VS.NET.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>HotKey functionality looks cool (didn't ASP.NET already have that?)</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Literals have a mode attribute that is really cool. Encode, Passthrough, and Transform.&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>-Encode html encodes the text</DIV><DIV>-Passthrough will output what ever is in the literal (the default)</DIV><DIV>-Transform removes markup</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Textboxes have a focus method now.&nbsp; (yay! /me does a dance *\_O_/* )</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>A new property called AutoCompleteType will read data out of a vcard that is provided to internet explorer and auto populate fields.&nbsp; Not that cool IMHO.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>ListItem objects now have an enabled property.&nbsp; Nifty, but I've never had to enable and disable listitems before.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Images now have a DescriptionUrl property.&nbsp; Chalk one up for accessibility!</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Tables have a caption tag.&nbsp; Don't get the big deal.&nbsp; It drops a label on top of the table.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Panel has a scroll bar property.&nbsp; I've always just used CSS to apply them. *shrug*</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Technorati Tags : <A href="http://technorati.com/tag/DevConnections" target=_blank rel=tag>DevConnections</A>, <A href="http://technorati.com/tag/ASPNET20" target=_blank rel=tag>ASPNET20</A><!-- End Technorati Tags --></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>.&nbsp;</DIV><!-- End Technorati Tags -->
