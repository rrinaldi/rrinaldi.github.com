As some people have probably already noticed, the dojo has been upgraded
to Community Server 2.0.  I'm quite happy with the new version, as I'm
sure a lot of people are.  If anything is broken, please let me know.

For any offline editors that you would like to use, please realize that
the MetaBlogApi location has changed.  It is now
[http://blogs.geekdojo.net/blogs/metablog.ashx](/blogs/metablog.ashx).

Thanks for the patience on the upgrade.  If I knew that the upgrade was
going to be as painless as it was, I would have upgrade sooner.  I was
expecting an upgrade like the .Text to CS 1.1 upgrade.  That was
something I would never want to go through again. :)
