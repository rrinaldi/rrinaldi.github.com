<p>Just found out that if you add a new project to a solution using the &ldquo;New Project In Existing Folder&rdquo; option of Visual Studio.NET 2003 the project doesn&rsquo;t define the DEBUG (or TRACE for that matter)&nbsp;compile directive, which is required for System.Diagnostics.Debug to do it&rsquo;s thing.</p> <p>Don&rsquo;t get burned like I did.&nbsp; Cost me 15 minutes of head scratching.</p>
