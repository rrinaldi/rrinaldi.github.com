Not really, but headlines are for attention grabbing. :)

[Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/index.html) brings up a
[few good points](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2004/01/28.html)
about .NET.  I don't necessarily agree with them, but hey it's a free
world and without a contrarian point of view, advances can't be made. 

I'll agree that the .NET framework is a large download.  I'll agree that
it might not be as widely distributed as some would like.  I'll even
agree that you need to really consider these two facts before deciding
to write and deploy a commercial application.  I won't agree though that
.NET is "fatally flawed for consumer, downloaded software". 

Because if that were true Java would have been fatally flawed and Visual
Basic would have been fatally flawed.  Java didn't sweep the nation
because it didn't look or feel like your standard applications and it
was painfully slow, but Visual Basic was probably one of the most widely
successful languages ever created (Please note, I did not say best
language.  Successful != Best).  Everybody and their brother was
creating and distributing Visual Basic applications.  .NET is seeing a
similar destiny.  One of the fastest adopted languages (by developers)
ever.  With SO many developers using it, it is only a matter of time
before the .NET framework is installed everywhere.

Right now, .NET might not be the platform of choice for Joel to write
software for.  That's fair.

Is .NET "fatally flawed"?  Of course not.

Will .NET still become ubiquitous? Of course.
