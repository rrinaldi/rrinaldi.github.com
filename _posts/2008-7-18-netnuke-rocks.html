<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I believe the title says it all.&nbsp; The last couple of days I've been toying around with <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com">.NetNuke</a>&nbsp;and I am quite impressed (to say the least).&nbsp; I first heard of .NetNuke shortly after I started developing in .NET but wrote it off as a clone of phpNuke or postNuke both of which started off as clones of Slashcode.&nbsp; (Looking at them now I realize that they both seem to have grown in complexity, probably surpassing Slashcode.)</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For those who don't know .NetNuke&nbsp;is an&nbsp;Open Source portal application written in VB.NET/ASP.NET.&nbsp; .NetNuke allows a user to manage content and design without any programming knowledge.&nbsp; Allowing people&nbsp;to create a 100% data-driven application.&nbsp; Basically SharePoint without all the hassle.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anyway, Monday I was listening to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.franklins.net/dotnetrocks/">.Net Rocks!</a>, the episode where they <a href="http://www.franklins.net/fnetdotnetrocks/dotnetrocks.aspx?showid=77">interview&nbsp;Shaun Walker and Jim Duffy</a>, and they wax on about the wonder that is .NetNuke.&nbsp; I couldn't help but get jazzed up about it.&nbsp; So I decided that I would download it and give it a shot.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">First off, it is easy to install.&nbsp; I went from downloaded to running in 10 minutes.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Second, easy to skin.&nbsp; I went from running to skinned in an hour with a custom skin the I created.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2 hours later I had converted our static intranet (which was a hassle to maintain) into a dynamic site complete with user based permissions that allowed different people rights to administer different portions of the site.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Not only that, but with all of the modules that come with it I was able to throw in a company wide event calendar, a discussion board, announcements, and a FAQ list.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I'm going to be using .NetNuke for a site I'm working on for my old high school and I might even get around to using it for a couple other things that have been on the back burner.....</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anyway, <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com/">go check it out</a>.&nbsp; I promise you that you will be impressed!</font></p>
