<P>I'm sitting at home this saturday evening doing some laundry and going through my laptop cleaning off unused programs.&nbsp; I noticed that I had VS 2003 installed, and now that our team is moving to Team Foundation Server I figured it was high time to install VS 2005 Team System on this baby.</P> <P>This is where I start to make software testers cry.</P> <P>I fire up my VPN over my wireless connection on the laptop, map a drive to a share on our corporate LAN, load up Microsoft's Virtual CD-ROM tool and point it to an ISO that is on the newly mapped drive.&nbsp; I then navigate on over to the virtual drive and fire up the VS 2005 install.</P> <P>So I'm running on a wireless network over a virtual network to create a mapped drive (which, when you think about it is merely a virtual pointer to a UNC share) so I can load another virtual drive to actually run my install.</P> <P>You think that edge case was tested? :)</P>
