<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">Well, now that the I completely botched the .Text upgrade on the server and spent all of my free time for the last 2 days replacing content that should have been backed up, I can finally sit back with a glass of wine, some John Mayer and relax.  Yeah I know it sounds fruity, but everybody needs to unwind somehow.  I don't know what exactly I did wrong when upgrading but I lost everything on the site.  Not a big deal if you backup your databases, but NO I'm a moron and the backups weren't working.  So thanks to a good friend of mine, <a href="http://www.google.com">Google Cache</a>, I was able to manually recreate about 90% of the content on the site.  The only things that got zapped were a single comment in <a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/jez">Ray's blog</a> and the last 4 posts that I made.  Wouldn't be a big problem if Ray wasn't so attached to that single comment :) I'm now off to double check all my updates and maybe get some sleep.</font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">In closing I give you these truths:</font></p> <ol> <li><font face="Georgia" size="2">Wine: Good!</font></li> <li><font face="Georgia" size="2">John Mayer: Good!</font></li> <li><font face="Georgia" size="2">Google Cache: Good!</font></li> <li><font face="Georgia" size="2">Not backing up databases: BAD!</font></li></ol> <p> </p>
