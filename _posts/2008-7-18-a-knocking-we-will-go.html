<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Port knocking that is.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I'm not a network admin, but I found <a href="http://www.portknocking.org/">this</a> quite interesting.&nbsp; A network security system designed around a "secret handshake" of sorts.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">An example:</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I want to SSH into a server.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Port 22 is closed.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">BUT, if I attempt connections to closed ports 1024, 88, 5632, and 9652 in succession port 22 will open and accept connections for the next 5 minutes.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It doesn't matter what port I want to connect to or what ports I attempt a connection to in succession.&nbsp; As long as the ports are&nbsp;part of the&nbsp;secret handshake.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I don't think I explained that very well, but check out the site.&nbsp; I'm sure things will be crystal afterward.</font></p>
