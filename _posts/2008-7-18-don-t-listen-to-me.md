So the [post](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan/posts/384.aspx) I made
yesterday about impersonation doesn't work.  Well, let me clarify that. 
It doesn't work for accessing network resources.  Impersonation only
lets you access resources local to the web server (as far as I can tell,
more research is definitely required on my part).  Apparently, it was
only working on my machine because I happened to be logged onto the web
server (my local box) when I was trying to impersonate myself.

After I figure out a proper way to do this, I'll be sure to fill you in.
