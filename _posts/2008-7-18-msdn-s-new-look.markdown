[Chris Kunicki](http://blogs.officezealot.com/chris/) [pointed
out](http://blogs.officezealot.com/chris/archives/000294.html) that
[MSDN got a new look](http://msdn.microsoft.com).  In his post he
mentions that the new version of the MSDN Library online is faster than
it used to be.  Also, amazingly, it seems to be faster than his local
version of the library.  My local version is quite snappy.  Anybody out
there have problems with their local version of MSDN being slow?
