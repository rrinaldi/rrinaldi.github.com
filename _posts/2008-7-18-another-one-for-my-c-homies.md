> In this segment Herb takes us on a tour of a small part of the Visual
> C++ team. In there you'll meet Jonathan Caves. He's a compiler
> developer on the VC++ team and he likes coffee. Starbucks coffee.\
>  \
>  Most of our applications, and Windows itself,Â are compiled with the
> VC++ team's amazing compiler. We talked a bit about the trends in the
> industry and how compilers are changing to react.\
>  \
>  In the hall we meet Chuck Mitchell, a senior architect on the VC++
> team. He kindly stops to chat with us about Phoenix which is a
> development framework for the next generation of compilers.\
