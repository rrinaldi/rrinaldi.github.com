<p>Over the past few months I&rsquo;ve accumulated (and lost) a few new gadgets:</p> <p><strong>Gadget the first:</strong> <a title="RAZR Phone" href="http://www.motorola.com/motoinfo/product/details.jsp?globalObjectId=69">A Motorola RAZR V3 Phone</a>.&nbsp; This guy replaced my old phone, a <a href="http://www.motorola.com/motoinfo/product/details.jsp?globalObjectId=11">V600</a>, which I really liked but the V600 decided he didn&rsquo;t like hearing me talk any more so he started dropping every call I made.&nbsp; Deciding that I wanted to actually talk to people with my phone I went over to my local T-Mobile store to see if there was a possibility of a replacement phone (since this one was rather new).&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t you know it?&nbsp; My warranty just expired so there was nothing that T-Mobile could do except sell me a new phone.&nbsp; (The lady behind the counter (now known as Counter Lady)&nbsp;was kind enough to tell me a good friend of hers happens to have a side business &ldquo;fixing&rdquo; phones and she would be happy to refer me to her friend.&nbsp; Thanks, but I would rather not get ripped off twice for the same transaction)&nbsp; Since I needed to have a phone (my cell being my only&nbsp;phone), I had to walk out with a working phone.&nbsp; After taking a quick glance around the room, I decided that the RAZR should suit my needs just fine.&nbsp; As&nbsp;Counter Lady rang up my new purchase, I proceeded to save the 5 or 6 contacts that were stored on my phone to my SIM card.&nbsp; Counter Lady sees me doing this one by one and decides that I should do it in a batch.&nbsp; Seems logical enough, so I hand my phone over to her and she clicks a few keys and hands it back.&nbsp; As I peruse what should be a list of over a hundred contacts, I find a list of the 5 that were still stored on my phone.&nbsp; Counter Lady *<strong>overwrote</strong>* my SIM card, instead of appending the contacts to them.&nbsp; After a bit of screaming and yelling, and me realizing that the data was gone, gone, gone I grabbed my new RAZR and headed out.&nbsp; T-Mobile now owns my soul for 2 more years and has wiped out the only contact information I had for a lot of people.&nbsp; I believe that requires a sarcastic yell. &ldquo;Yay!&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>Gadget B:</strong> The must have gadget of the century, an iPod.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">Nano 1 GB</a> to be exact.&nbsp; I got to enjoy the wonderful bliss of owning an iPod for 1 1/2 whole months before it got swiped of my desk at work. :(&nbsp; In a rather idiotic display of cunning and intelligence, at the last minute I decided to not take my iPod with me to the <a href="http://www.jpmorganchasecc.com/">JP Morgan Chase Corporate Challenge</a>.&nbsp; Thinking that since I have never ran with the iPod it would be stupid to try to when I&rsquo;m doing my first race ever.&nbsp; Casually I tossed it on my desk, and it was never seen again.&nbsp; As much fun as the iPod was, he will probably be replaced by a device that supports <a title="Evil DRM" href="http://www.playsforsure.com/">PlaysForSure</a>&nbsp;so I can upgrade my Rhapsody account to RhapsodyToGo and get 2 million songs to go.&nbsp; (I dig the subscription music model.)</p> <p><strong>Gadget number 3</strong>: <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/Detail.aspx?device=8802ddeb-1ee4-477a-9608-d9cd1e2a903f">T-Mobile MDA</a> (aka HTC Wizard).&nbsp; Work gave me this guy to replace my BlackBerry.&nbsp; Since the first day I saw the HTC Wizard I wanted one.&nbsp; Craved it.&nbsp; I HAD TO HAVE IT.&nbsp; Which is why, with great disappointment, I say&nbsp;I miss my BlackBerry.&nbsp; The MDA has been a huge disappointment for me.&nbsp; It all comes down to what you want a device to do and what the device was made to do.&nbsp; I want/need something that is great at email.&nbsp; The BlackBerry was that.&nbsp; The MDA on the other hand isn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; The MDA is great at being a phone, calendar and managing contacts.&nbsp; Email comes second on the MDA.&nbsp; Simple as that.</p> <p><strong>Gadget IV:</strong> This guy I&rsquo;ve ordered but he hasn&rsquo;t arrived yet. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ICEIQ/002-9098812-9581660?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance&amp;n=172282">Linkstation 250 GB Network Storage Center</a>. Aww yeah.&nbsp; My laptop, <a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan/archive/2005/03/24/7538.aspx">MojoDojo</a>, has been running out of hard-drive space for sometime and I didn&rsquo;t want to buy a really expensive laptop drive and&nbsp;deal with migrating tons of stuff over to it.&nbsp; An&nbsp;external hard-drive was out of the question because I wanted the&nbsp;laptop&nbsp;to be mobile and not tethered to a hard-drive by a USB cable.&nbsp; 250 GB that can be mounted over the network was&nbsp;just the solution I needed. (I think, I have yet to try this out in the real world.)&nbsp;</p>
