<p>After attending quite a few of these events (in Chicago at least), I&rsquo;ve discovered that a lot of them break down into very similar conversations month after month:</p> <ul> <li>&ldquo;Did you see &lt;Insert new Xbox game&gt; yet?&rdquo; &ndash; This one comes up quite often and can bring any current conversation to a grinding halt.</li> <li>&ldquo;TiVo is better than Media Center&rdquo; or &ldquo;Media Center is better than TiVo&rdquo; &ndash; I won&rsquo;t call it a holy war, but the conversation can get a little heated at times. <img src="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan/images/smile3.gif" /></li> <li>&ldquo;Did you download the latest &lt;insert Microsoft Beta product&gt;?&rdquo; &ndash; Seems that lately almost every month there is some beta being released by MS that everybody seems to download then do absolutely nothing with. (I&rsquo;m one of them <img src="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan/images/smile3.gif" />)</li> <li>&ldquo;I wrote this cool little utility that does X.&rdquo; &ndash; These are by far the coolest conversations in my opinion.&nbsp; Somebody always seems to have some little tool they hacked together that makes their life so much easier. I just sit back and think &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I do that?&rdquo;.</li> <li>&ldquo;Check out my new toy!&rdquo; &ndash; Needs no explanation.&nbsp; Geeks dig the shiny!</li></ul> <p>So you don&rsquo;t get the wrong idea, I&rsquo;m not saying that this is a bad thing or I wish the conversations where different.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m just pointing out an observation.</p> <p>Are the Nerd Dinners in other areas the same?</p>
