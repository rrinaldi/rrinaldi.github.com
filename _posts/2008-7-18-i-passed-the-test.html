<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>So I have this new budget setup right?&nbsp; Got Microsoft Money 2004 (which rocks BTW, I will write&nbsp;a review as soon as I spend some more time with it (Get it? Spend?&nbsp;&nbsp;HAHA, I crack myself up)) running, budget budgeting, accounts accounting, cash flow forecasts forecasting and then my wonderful roommate, </FONT><A href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/andy"><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Andy</FONT></A><FONT face=Verdana size=2>, needs&nbsp;a ride to the two pillars of geekdom: BestBuy and MicroCenter.&nbsp; Just hearing the names of those two wonderful stores starts my salivary glands up.&nbsp; Going there causes me to go into some sort of trance, like a drug crazed trip through heaven.</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Well, normally it would.&nbsp; But this time, I couldn't let myself spend a dime.&nbsp; You know, I have a BUDGET now and that BUDGET means that I can't do squat.&nbsp; So I became a fiscally conservative geek and perused the aisles imagining what it would be like to have another 100 feet of CAT 5 cable, or a 6 port USB hub or any random piece of useless geekery.</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>I was able to walk away from both places without spending a dime.</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>I win.</FONT></P>
