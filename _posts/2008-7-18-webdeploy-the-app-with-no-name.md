[Matt](http://weblogs.asp.net/mhawley) needs your help in [choosing a
new name for
WebDeploy](http://weblogs.asp.net/mhawley/archive/2004/08/05/209235.aspx)
so Wise won't send a pack of rabid attack lawyers to his doorstep. 

**Why does he need your help?**

Well, choosing a cool name is hard work and Matt is completely drained
because he has been crankin' away adding features to a really cool app
that he is giving away.

**Why should I spend my time and burn out brain cells so I can think up
a cool name for Matt?**

Because he is practically paying you to!  If the new application name
you submitted is chosen you get the glamour and prestige of having your
name in an official Matt Hawley produced application! But not only that,
you get a **FREE** license to his custom controls!  The license is a
\$75 dollar value for a total prize package of 75\$ + fame and fortune.
(Fame and fortune not guaranteed.)

**Where can I get more information?**

Glad you asked!  Head on over to [Matt's
blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/mhawley) and [read the submission
guidelines](http://weblogs.asp.net/mhawley/archive/2004/08/05/209235.aspx).
