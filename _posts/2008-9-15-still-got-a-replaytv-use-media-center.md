If you still happen to have a ReplayTV and you now use Windows Media
Center I suggest you take a look at [this blog
post](http://ray.jez.net/?p=503) that my boss, [Ray
Jezek](http://ray.jez.net/) put up on his new site.Â  He created a small
app called [Replay2DVRMS](http://ray.jez.net/?p=503) that takes Replay
files and converts them into DVR-ms files suitable for use with Windows
Media Center.
