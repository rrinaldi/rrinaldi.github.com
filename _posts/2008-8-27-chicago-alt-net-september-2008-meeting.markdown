**Inversion of Control for the masses**

6:00 PM \
Pizza and networking time

6:30 PM \
[John Nuechterlein](http://www.blogcoward.com/) (a.k.a. **jdn**) puts
Inversion of Control (IoC) containers under the spotlight. If you have
been noticing the increasing buzz around this technology but never had a
chance to see what it is and how it can be used, this is your chance to
see:

-   An overview of what IoC is, using
    [StructureMap](http://structuremap.sourceforge.net/) as the example
-   Why one might want to use IoC
-   How one can implement IoC
-   When one might not use IoC

7:45 PM \
You may want to stick around after the presentation portion of the
meeting and take part in our monthly open discussion. The topic is never
arranged in advance but it's common that it reflects the content of the
presentation.
