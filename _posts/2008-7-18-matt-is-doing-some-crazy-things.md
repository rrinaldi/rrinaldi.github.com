[Matt Hawley](http://weblogs.asp.net/mhawley) has been doing some real
crazy things with Web Deploy.  He is [putting in file
masks](http://weblogs.asp.net/mhawley/archive/2004/07/15/184492.aspx),
added some different backup options and all in all creating a really,
really cool tool.  This is definitely one that I can't live without any
more.

As an aside, I think everybody should know that Matt is really working
hard on Web Deploy and could really use your feedback.  Let him know if
you use it, why you use it, how you use it and if you don't use it, why
not? :)
