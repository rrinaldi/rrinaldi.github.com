So I'm currently listening to [DotNet
Rocks!](http://www.franklins.net/dotnetrocks/) on my new Nomad Zen Xtra
Jukebox (more on my new toy later) and I have a couple things I need to
point out:

1.) [Rory](http://www.neopoleon.com/blog/) made a reference to
wxWindows.  FYI, wxWindows changed it's name to wxWidgets a couple
months ago.  Apparently the mother ship (Microsoft) has taken issue with
the toolkits name.  You can find more on the name
change [here](http://www.wxwindows.org/name.htm). 

2.) A little confession: this was my first time listening to dotNet
Rocks and now I'm hooked.  How could I live without this in my life? 
DotNet Rocks, you complete me.

3.) I just finsihed listening to it and I recommend that anybody that is
interested in SOA needs to listen to the episode with Clemens.  Go
download it now.  I'll still be here after you do.  SOA makes so much
sense now it's un-freakin-believable.

4.) Clemens made the comment that there are not enough Software
Architects out there. I whole-heartily agree with him.  I hope to be one
someday (I still have a lot of industry dues to pay first.)
