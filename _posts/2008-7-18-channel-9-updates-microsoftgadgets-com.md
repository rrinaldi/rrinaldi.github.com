Noticed today that
[Microsoftgadgets.com](http://microsoftgadgets.com/) was updated!  After
taking a spin around the site I noticed a post from Jeff Sandquist
making the [‘official’
announcement](http://www.jeffsandquist.com/WhyAreMyEyesBloodshot.aspx).

It’s a shame that microsoftgadgets.com is being trolled by Mac fan-boys
that can do nothing better than rehash the same arguments: 1.) “Apple
had gadgets in the 1980s with the introduction of the Lisa!!!” or the
often repeated phrase 2.) “Redmond, start your copiers!”.

\*sigh\*  Maybe I’ll go into why both of these statements are completely
braindead at a later date.
