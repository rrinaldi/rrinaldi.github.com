After attending quite a few of these events (in Chicago at least), I’ve
discovered that a lot of them break down into very similar conversations
month after month:

-   “Did you see \<Insert new Xbox game\> yet?” – This one comes up
    quite often and can bring any current conversation to a grinding
    halt.
-   “TiVo is better than Media Center” or “Media Center is better than
    TiVo” – I won’t call it a holy war, but the conversation can get a
    little heated at times.

-   “Did you download the latest \<insert Microsoft Beta product\>?” –
    Seems that lately almost every month there is some beta being
    released by MS that everybody seems to download then do absolutely
    nothing with. (I’m one of them

-   “I wrote this cool little utility that does X.” – These are by far
    the coolest conversations in my opinion.  Somebody always seems to
    have some little tool they hacked together that makes their life so
    much easier. I just sit back and think “Why didn’t I do that?”.
-   “Check out my new toy!” – Needs no explanation.  Geeks dig the
    shiny!

So you don’t get the wrong idea, I’m not saying that this is a bad thing
or I wish the conversations where different.  I’m just pointing out an
observation.

Are the Nerd Dinners in other areas the same?
