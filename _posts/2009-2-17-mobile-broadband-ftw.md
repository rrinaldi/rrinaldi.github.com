I was telling a coworker the other day how awesome it is to fire up the
internet on my way into work on the train.  Since he also takes the
train and has a longer commute then me I suggested he give it a try. 
First question that came up was “Is it really fast enough to get work
done?”

It’s not cable modem speeds but it sure is fast enough for most things! 
I’m able to pull down code from svn repositories, I’ve done svn commits,
twittered, googled all without a hitch. I’m loving it.
