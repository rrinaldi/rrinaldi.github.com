My brother (Robert Hendry) just had a new book published, and I figured
I would use my space here to give him a little plug.

[Modeling Financial Markets: Using Visual Basic.NET and Databases to
Create Pricing, Trading, and Risk Management
Models](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0071417729/qid=1076953438/sr=1-8/ref=sr_1_8/002-1378208-6312012?v=glance&s=books).

I haven't read it yet, but I don't need to.  I know it's good cause my
big bro wrote it. :)  (Also, it has been getting good reviews on
Amazon.)
