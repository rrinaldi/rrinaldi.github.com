<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Sorry that the site has been serving up an error page for the last 12 hours or so when clicking on a post to view the comments.&nbsp; I just got home and decided to investigate the error and after setting the custom error setting in the web.config file to &#8220;Off&#8221;, the error magically went away.&nbsp; Poof!&nbsp; Gone.&nbsp; Banished to the land of wind and ghosts.&nbsp;After putting the setting back to &#8220;RemoteOnly&#8221; everything still works.&nbsp; I guess the app needed to be restarted.&nbsp; Maybe it was just tired.&nbsp; Or worse yet, it became self aware (I believe Scott wrote a provider for that...) and figured out it was&nbsp;a blogging engine, spewing half formed thoughts into the ether and tried to kill itself.&nbsp; Either way, I hope it doesn't happen again.</FONT></P>
