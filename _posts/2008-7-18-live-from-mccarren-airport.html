<DIV>Well, DevConnections is over.&nbsp; Had a good time and met some good people.&nbsp; Juval Lowy's session on VS 2005 and C# 2.0 was excellent.&nbsp; He reaffirmed a lot of my thoughts on C# 2.0 and taught me quite a bit in the process.&nbsp; Coming from a non-CS background, sometimes it takes me longer than I would like to understand very CS topics like generics and anonymous methods.&nbsp; (Polymorphism and inheritence also took some time.&nbsp; I had a very hard time wrapping my head around it initially and when I did get it, it was a&nbsp;"a-ha" moment.)</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>My plane is now boarding so I'm off to my homeland of good ol' chicago!&nbsp; I stopped off earlier to fill up my tank of liquid courage so I will see you all on the other side.&nbsp; </DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Oh yeah, leaving Vegas up 300 and some dollars is&nbsp;a good feeling!</DIV>
