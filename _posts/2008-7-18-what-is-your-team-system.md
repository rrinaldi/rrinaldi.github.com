I noticed a lot of posts the other day where people rattled off what
they are currently using to mimic all of the functionality that you will
be getting with Team System.  At my office, we don't have a very
extensive list and I think it is pretty common:

-   [NUnit 2.2](http://www.nunit.org/) (via TestDriven.NET)
-   [NAnt](http://nant.sourceforge.net/)
-   [Cruise Control.NET](http://ccnet.thoughtworks.com/) for [Continuous
    Integration](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html)
-   [Clover.NET](http://cenqua.com/clover.net/) for code coverage
    (currently looking into it, any opinions?)
-   [NDoc](http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/)

I can't seem to think of anything else in our environment, but I have a
nagging feeling I'm forgetting something.

 

Anyway, so what do you use for your "Team System"?
