<P>Does anybody know of any Tablets that support SXGA (1280 x 1024)?&nbsp;.&nbsp; So far all I can find is XGA (1024 x 768). I'm currently working on a Dell laptop that has UXGA (1600 x 1200) and I'm a little scared to give up that much screen real estate.</P> <P>Also, I'm looking at the Acer 300XCi.&nbsp; Any opinions?&nbsp; Any horror stories?</P>
