<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">block the spam, block the spam early in the morning....</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So the past couple weeks I've been kinda busy with work, but I managed to find some spare time to add a few spam blocking measures to the ol' dojo here.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I blacklisted a few hundred IPs that are known spammers.&nbsp; I got the list from <a href="http://www.commentspam.org/">CommentSpam.org</a>, run by <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rmclaws/">Robert McLaws</a>.&nbsp; Be careful though, as the list from Robert isn't straight up compatible with the HttpModule I used to do the IP blocking, written by <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hanselman</a>.&nbsp; Robert is taking the IPs from the <a title="" href="http://www.scottwater.com/dottext" >.Text</a> comments, which sometimes contains a comma delimited list of IPs which kills the HttpModule.&nbsp; I'm think I'm going to try to work something out so the 2 function together "out-of-the-box", but I'll probably never get around to it. :(</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I added the <a href="http://blogs.clearscreen.com/migs/archive/2004/11/10/575.aspx">Clearscreen SharpHIP HIP-CAPTCHA</a> control to all of the blogs on this site, as a means to stop automated spambots.&nbsp; Yeah, it's a pain to type in crap that is hard to read, and it is a little flakey since it is added without modifying the source.&nbsp; But it's better than the alternative of deleting 200+ spams.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So, if you get past the blacklist and the CAPTCHA, I assume you are non-spamming human.&nbsp; If you are a non-spamming human, feel free to post a comment.&nbsp; If your comment happens to contain various "spammy" keywords, it will probably get picked up by my spam sweeper in the evening.&nbsp; I assume that since none of the content here is related to poker or pharmaceuticals of any kind the spam sweeper is a pretty safe bet.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Was all of this a pain?&nbsp; Yeah, but what you going to do?&nbsp; Add some sort of tag to links that will lower the relevancy of those links in search results?&nbsp; Like that would ever work.... ;)</font></p>
