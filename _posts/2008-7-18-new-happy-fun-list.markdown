The [2004 List of Banished
Words](http://www.lssu.edu/banished/archive/2004.php) has just been
published.

Can I request that we bring back "Da Bomb"?

Also as a Chicagoan I should point out that there is no Frank and
Johnnie show on WGN.  There is a wonderful "[Steve and
Johnnie](http://wgnradio.com/shows/steve_johnnie/index.html)" show
though.
