Last night the [Chicago Nerd Dinner - Downtown
Edition](http://nerddinner.com/blogs/chicago/archive/2005/05/09/ChicagoNerdDinnerDowntownEditionMay23rd.aspx)
was a success.  We had 9 people show up, including 3 that we thought had
fallen off the face of the earth.  Conversation was great and some
really great ideas were tossed around.  Around 7:30 we were kicked from
the main dining room and moved over to the pool room for a couple more
“beverages” before the night was over. 
[Jeff](http://weblogs.asp.net/jkey),
[Brian](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/brian) and I spent quite a bit of time
playing very mediocre pool.  Our combined pool IQ is the same as a
slightly used dish-rag, so adding a few beers to the mix was probably
not the best way to expedite our games.  At the end of the evening, we
tallied up our records and it seems to break down like this:

**Ryan**: 1 game

**Brian**: 2 games

**Jeff:** 157 games

Jeff is quite adamant that we played at least 160 games and he won a
good deal of them.  I’m quite sure we didn’t, but after a few beers Jeff
can be quite pushy.

So all in all it was quite a good evening and I hope we see everybody
again next month!
