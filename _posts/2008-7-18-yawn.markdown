Oh hey!  How you been? 

Long time no see.  How's the kids? 

Good, good. oh me?  I'm fine, just sitting here having a conversation
with my blog.  No biggie.

Really?  Psychiatric help? Why?

"Cause I'm talking to a website."?  Yeah I guess I can see how others
would find that a little disconcerting.

I apologize for being away for so long but it appears that life got in
the way of the blog.

Work has been mighty crazy lately and I've been pulling some insane
hours trying to keep up with it.  I finally got to a point where I feel
like I can go home for awhile and relax. (It is 4:30 on a Saturday and I
shouldn't be sitting at my desk anyway. It's fifty freakin' degrees
outside for god's sake (in Chicago! (in February!!))).

I'll throw a couple posts up here on Ye Olde Blog and then I'm out the
door. Enjoy the rest of the weekend!
