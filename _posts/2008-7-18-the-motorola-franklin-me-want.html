Last we heard, Motorola was working on a Blackberry-killer type qwerty candybar that was going to be done in the style of the RAZR, which some were referring to as RAZRberry. Well, we’ve got the exclusive for ya: the device is codenamed the Franklin, and will have quad-band GPRS/EDGE, 128MB flash and 64MB RAM memory, Bluetooth, a 1.3-megapixel camera, MiniSD slot, 2.4-inch 320 x 240 65k color screen, and will apparently run Windows Mobile 5.0. Oh, and did we mention it’s freaking 112 x 64 x 11.5mm (4.4 x 2.5 x 0.45-inches) and won’t weigh more than 115g (4oz)? So <EM>this</EM> is what it feels like to be in love.</P> <P>Via <A href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000577048252/">Engadget</A><BR></P>
