After a scare, we are back up and running!  I really need to thank Brian
for coming through with a server to host the dojo!\
\
As soon as things get settled, there will be a few changes around here.
First of all, now that the Geekdojo has a second lease on life, I'm not
going to take it for granted.  Maybe it's because of the new year or
because I almost had my "voice on the internet" taken away from me, but
I'll try my best to post more often.  When I think back and realize that
three years ago we started this humble site I had a pretty powerful
voice in the .NET development community and for some reason or another
I've let that slide.  I'm resolving to try to change that.  There are a
lot more voices out there now then there were three years ago, but my
opinion is as valid as the next and by God I'll be out there shouting
it! :)\
\
Second, I'm sorry to say, is that I'm going to be putting up more Google
Ads.  I wish I didn't have to, but now that the site is being hosted on
server that a friend is shelling out good money for I feel that it is a
necessity.  If there are any problems with that, or you have a better
idea on how to try to generate revenue to cover our costs let me know.\

Thanks again Brian!  You've truly blessed us and it is greatly
appreciated!
