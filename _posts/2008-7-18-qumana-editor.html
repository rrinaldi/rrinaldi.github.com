<P>By the way, this post and the last one are/were written using a new editor I found called <A href="http://www.qumana.com/">Qumana</A>.&nbsp; It's free and pretty good.&nbsp; It doesn't seem to support the community server categories, but it does have technorati tags which seem to make up for it a little bit.&nbsp; It has a slicker interface than any of the other tools I've used (it has more of an Office feel, rather than Notepad).&nbsp; It also comes with some tools to insert ads into your posts, which in Scoble speak is how they plan to "Monitize" their software.</P><P>If you are looking for an editor, check it out.&nbsp; With spell check, a thesaraus and multiple blog support it pretty slick. (I hope the fix the category issue, because I'll probably still use BlogJet but Qumana is a real close second.)</P><P>Technorati Tags : <A href="http://technorati.com/tag/blogtools" target=_blank rel=tag>blogtools</A><!-- End Technorati Tags --><!-- End Technorati Tags --></P>
