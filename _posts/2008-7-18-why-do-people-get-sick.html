<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">If you've read my blog before, <a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan/posts/175.aspx">you would know</a> that I spend a lot of my time volunteering with the <a href="http://www.specialolympics.org/">Special Olympics</a>.  One of the kids that I work with was in the hospital for the last couple of weeks (unbeknownst to me).  He came home the other day.  The doctors say his liver is failing.  He doesn't have much time to live.</font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">Why does a person who has already had SO many problems in his life, have to have it end early? Bah.  I take some comfort in the fact that he had a wonderful summer.  He and his father went to the State Championships for golf, and he seemed to be loving life.</font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">When you read this, do me a favor and say a little prayer.  You don't need to say much, just a little “Hey, keep your eyes out for this one.  He's a keeper.”  </font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">Thanks.</font></p>
