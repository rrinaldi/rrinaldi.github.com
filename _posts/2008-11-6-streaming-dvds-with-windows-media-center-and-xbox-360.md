One of things I've been trying to put together in my spare time is a
home media center.  I got an XBOX 360 and using that as my Media Center
Extender my goal is to stream backups of my DVDs that I ripped to my PC
that is running Windows Media Center.  Unfortunately I haven't been able
to come up with a solution that I find acceptable.  I attempted to use
Transcode360 to stream VIDEO\_TS but it doesn't appear to even see the
files on my machine.  I then converted my VIDEO\_TS files to WMV and
while I can stream that, losing FF/RW is unacceptable. (Side note: Maybe
FF/RW works with WMV but trying to use the XBOX controller as a remote
is painful.  I should probably pickup a real remote for it.  That will
go on my list of things to buy.) 

 

Does anybody out there have any suggestions as to what I can do to
realize my dream of a DVD jukebox?  I haven't attempted straight-up
MPEG-2 yet, but that is my next step.  Any help would be appreciated!
