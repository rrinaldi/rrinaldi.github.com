Does anybody know of any Tablets that support SXGA (1280 x 1024)? .  So
far all I can find is XGA (1024 x 768). I'm currently working on a Dell
laptop that has UXGA (1600 x 1200) and I'm a little scared to give up
that much screen real estate.

Also, I'm looking at the Acer 300XCi.  Any opinions?  Any horror
stories?
