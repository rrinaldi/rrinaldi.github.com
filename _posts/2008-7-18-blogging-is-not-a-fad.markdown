title: blogging-is-not-a-fad

Maybe it hit me later than most, but I finally believe that blogging is
more than just a fad.  Maybe it is the rumor that BillG will be blogging
or the fact that the [COO of Sun is
blogging](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan/).  Blogging has
created the Utopia of self publishing that the Internet was proclaimed
to be.  Seriously, reading this is proof.  Would any newspaper or
magazine publish my ramblings?  Hell no.  But people read it anyway. 
Maybe Google will get you here, or maybe you're one of my few friends
that actually read this drivel. :)  Anyway, I find it quite liberating
that I'm able to freely publish my thoughts as easily as the COO of Sun
does and if my thoughts are the least bit interesting people will read
it.
