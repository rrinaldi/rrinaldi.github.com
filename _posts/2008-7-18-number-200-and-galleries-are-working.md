It took a bit of time, but I finally hit 200 posts!

It took me almost as long to get the galleries working as it did to hit
200.  To everybody that was waiting on that, I apologize.  I didn’t
think that it would take as long as it did.  And if it wasn’t for
inspiration striking at lunch today, I’m not sure I would have ever
gotten the galleries functioning properly.

Here are some things to be looking forward to:

1.) I did get a designer to work on something for the site.  I’ve been
working on getting onto the site.  I have the main page down, but I need
to hit a few more before I can migrate to it.

2.) As soon as we get some more space on the server, I will probably add
the Community Server FTP service, so everybody can go nuts uploading
pictures to the site.

3.) Server…..Needs…….RAM……Will….Get…..Some….Soon…..

4.) Before number 1 gets done, I have a feeling that CS 1.1 will be
loaded onto the site.

5.) Depending on what features are available in CS 1.1, I might add in
some more features to the MetaBlogApi.  (Time will tell)
