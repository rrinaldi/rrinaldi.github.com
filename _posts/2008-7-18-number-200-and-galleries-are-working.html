<P>It took a bit of&nbsp;time, but I finally hit 200 posts!</P> <P>It took me almost as long to get the galleries working as it did to hit 200.&nbsp; To everybody that was waiting on that, I apologize.&nbsp; I didn’t think that it would take as long as it did.&nbsp; And if it wasn’t for inspiration striking at lunch today, I’m not sure I would have ever gotten the galleries functioning properly.</P> <P>Here are some things to be looking forward to:</P> <P>1.) I did get a designer to work on something for the site.&nbsp; I’ve been working on getting onto the site.&nbsp; I have the main page down, but I need to hit a few more before I can migrate to it.</P> <P>2.)&nbsp;As soon as we get some more space on the server, I will probably add the Community Server FTP service, so everybody can go nuts uploading pictures to the site.</P> <P>3.) Server…..Needs…….RAM……Will….Get…..Some….Soon…..</P> <P>4.) Before number 1 gets done, I have a feeling that CS 1.1 will be loaded onto the site.</P> <P>5.) Depending on what features are available in CS 1.1, I might add in some more features to the MetaBlogApi.&nbsp; (Time will tell)</P>
