<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Well you can't.</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>I just upgraded to Office 2003 today and so far I like it.&nbsp; Outlook 2k3 is fan-freakin'-tastic.&nbsp; Almost a lickable interface. (<FONT size=1>The shnozberries taste like shnozberry.</FONT>)</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Since I use <A href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan/posts/219.aspx">SpamBayes</A>&nbsp;for Spam filtering I had a folder named Junk Suspects and another named Junk E-mail.&nbsp; After upgrading to 2k3 I now had another named Junk E-mail1 that Outlook was going to use to store Spam.&nbsp; This was not acceptable.&nbsp; I figured&nbsp;I would just&nbsp;delete that folder and tell Outlook to use the existing Junk E-mail folder.&nbsp; Well, you can't customize where Outlook stores it's Spam.</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Since I couldn't change that setting I changed SpamBayes to point to the new Junk E-Mail1 folder and I deleted the Junk E-Mail folder.&nbsp; I assumed that I would be able to rename the Junk E-Mail1 folder.&nbsp; When you rename or move folders in Outlook, Rules and plug-ins that use those folders automagically point to the new folder, so I didn't think there would be any problems renaming it.&nbsp; Well Outlook won't let you rename it.</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>After searching for awhile, I came across <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;296192">this KB article</A> describing the Outlook commandline switches.&nbsp; It seems that the switch <FONT face="Courier New">/ResetFolderNames</FONT> will rename all the special folders back to their default names.&nbsp; For me that's all I needed.&nbsp; Running Outlook with that switch renamed Junk E-Mail1 back to Junk E-Mail and allowed be to be sane again.</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>If you want to change the name to anything else, you seem to be SOL for now.&nbsp; Probably one of the dumbest decisions I have seen.&nbsp; Why <EM>wouldn't</EM> you let someone rename that folder?&nbsp; Maybe they wanted to name the folder &#8220;Spam&#8221; or &#8220;Evil mail go here&#8221; or &#8220;BAD&#8221;?&nbsp; Whatever the reason Outlook should allow it.</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>So, if you are upgrading Outlook 2000 to 2003 and you use SpamBayes you'll need to do the following so you can only have one Spam folder:</FONT></P> <UL> <LI><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Delete the folder &#8220;Junk E-Mail&#8220;</FONT> <LI><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Point SpamBayes to the &#8220;Junk E-Mail1&#8220; folder</FONT> <LI><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Close Outlook</FONT> <LI><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Run Outlook with the /ResetFolderNames switch.</FONT></LI></UL> <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>The command line that you run should look something like this:</FONT></P> <P><FONT face="Courier New" size=2>"c:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\OFFICE11\OUTLOOK.EXE" /ResetFolderNames</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>After that everything should be fine.</FONT></P>
