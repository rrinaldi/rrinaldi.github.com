[Reflector](http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/index.htm) has
been acquired by [Red Gate Software](http://www.red-gate.com/).Â  When I
first heard about it, I was a bit uneasy about the idea but after
reading [this
interview](http://www.simple-talk.com/opinion/opinion-pieces/the-future-of-reflector-/)
with Lutz and James Moore from Red Gate, I'm feeling a little better.
