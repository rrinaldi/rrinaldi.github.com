Today the session quality was "iffy".  I wound up leaving a few early,
normally because the presenter named his or her session poorly.  Please
people if you are going to be presenting on a topic name your
presentations correctly.  If you are going to be showing an overview of
a technology, don't call it "Developing with Technology X" call it an
overview.  Please don't name your sessions things like "Indigo says Hi!"
or "You, ASP.NET and Me".  WTF?  How am I supposed to figure out what
that session is about?  It might be great, or it might be boring.  My
work spent good money to get me out here, and I'm not going to take a
stab in the dark.  If I can't figure out what the session is, I'm not
going.  Simple. 
 
On another note, the people in charge seem to realize that giving 3000
people 30 minutes to travel a half a mile to the expo area and back for
a break is braindead.  They moved the refreshments this afternoon to the
hallway outside the sessions.  Good move!
 
This evening I'm going out for a little night on the town.  I'll
probably start with some craps at Mandalay, but later on I'm going to
see Avenue Q with my buddy Richard (who also was able to con work into
sending him out here).
