<p>(Holy long session name Batman!)</p> <ul> <li>Tools shipping in 2010</li> <ul> <li>PLINQ</li> <li>Task Parallel Library</li> <li>Concurrency Runtime Threadpool</li> <li>Parallel Debugger tool windows</li></ul> <li>Demo of a Ray tracer running in Serial versus Parallel</li> <li>Hardware manufactures are talking about 80 to 100 cores on the desktop</li> <ul> <li>Now is the time to go parallel</li></ul> <li>Threding/Concurrency versus Parallel </li> <ul> <li>Concurrency versus Exploitable concurrency</li> <li>To actual improve performance you need to go multi-core</li></ul></ul> <p>Yay! This is a "mostly-code" demo</p> <ul> <li>Fine Grained Parallelism Demo: From thread based to Task Based</li> <ul> <li>Creating a tree with 1003 nodes</li> <li>Processing takes 15 seconds or so</li> <li>If you create threads each thread requires 1 meg of memory</li> <li>Parallel framework handles creating threads (1 per core)</li> <ul> <li>Now the program takes 3 seconds</li></ul> <li>User mode scheduler for tasks</li> <ul> <li>Each thread has a local queue so if a thread creates a task it stays on it's thread</li> <ul> <li>If a thread has nothing to do, it steals work from other threads queues but always from the back of the queue</li></ul></ul> <li>Task has some helper methods that helps manage tasks and waiting for task completion</li> <li>Tasks are lightweight.</li> <li>Tasks.ContinueWith takes a lamda and calls it when the task is complete.&nbsp; Can be used for chaining</li> <li>When a task creates tasks it has a parent child relationship, Task A cannot complete until it's child tasks do. Unless you specify that the child tasks are Detached</li> <li>Tasks support Cancellation</li> <li>Task objects also supports methods that return data</li> <ul> <li>Tasks that return values are called Futures</li> <ul> <li>Only in the CTP, in RTM it will be called Task&lt;T&gt;</li></ul></ul></ul> <li>System.Threading.Tasks</li> <ul> <li>Has all the Parallel framework stuff</li></ul> <li>Demo of the Parallel Debugger Tool Windows</li> <ul> <li>If you look at the Threads window you have to check the callstack of all the threads window</li> <li>Introduced the Parallel Tasks Window</li> <ul> <li>Fully integrated</li></ul> <li>Also have a Parellel Stacks Window</li> <ul> <li>This is super awesome.</li> <li>Like really. Over the top, super cool Thread and Task visualization</li></ul></ul></ul> <p>Battery is dying, so I'm out.&nbsp; Hopefully I'll find power at my next session.</p>
