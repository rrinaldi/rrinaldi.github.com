<p>Last night the <a href="http://nerddinner.com/blogs/chicago/archive/2005/05/09/ChicagoNerdDinnerDowntownEditionMay23rd.aspx">Chicago Nerd Dinner - Downtown Edition</a> was a success.&nbsp; We had 9 people show up, including 3 that we thought had fallen off the face of the earth.&nbsp; Conversation was great and some really great ideas were tossed around.&nbsp; Around 7:30 we were kicked from the main dining room and moved over to the pool room for a couple more &ldquo;beverages&rdquo; before the night was over.&nbsp; <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jkey">Jeff</a>, <a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/brian">Brian</a> and I spent quite a bit of time playing very mediocre pool.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our combined pool IQ is the same as a slightly used dish-rag, so adding a few beers to the mix was probably not the best way to expedite our games.&nbsp; At the end of the evening, we tallied up our records and it seems to break down like this:</p> <p><strong>Ryan</strong>: 1 game</p> <p><strong>Brian</strong>: 2 games</p> <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> 157 games</p> <p>Jeff is quite adamant that we played at least 160 games and he won a good deal of them.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m quite sure we didn&rsquo;t, but after a few beers Jeff can be quite pushy. <img src="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan/images/smile1.gif" /></p> <p>So all in all it was quite a good evening and I hope we see everybody again next month!</p>
