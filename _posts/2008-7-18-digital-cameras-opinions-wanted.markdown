Sunday I was doing some non-tech work at the [NBC5 Health and
Fitness Expo](http://www.nbc5.com/health/2791599/detail.html?z=dp&dpswid=2283706&dppid=65194)
at Navy Pier in Chicago for [Home Spa
Sessions](http://www.corporatemassages.com/HSS/HSS.htm) and during a
quick break I was walking around outside just looking out at Lake
Michigan and the skyline.  I've lived in and around Chicago for my
entire life, and I never really took in what a great town Chicago really
is. Looking out over the lake front from the Pier or turning around and
seeing the skyline in winter is magnificent.  Probably one of the
greatest views one can behold.  I stood there for awhile and I thought
how cool it would be to take some pictures.  Too bad I don't have a
camera.

So that brings me to this: I can afford to drop maybe 400 bucks on a
digital camera.  What would you recommend?  I looked around online and I
haven't seen anything that jumps out at me as the best bang for my
buck.  I'm hoping to get 3 megapixels and decent optical zoom.  Any
ideas?
