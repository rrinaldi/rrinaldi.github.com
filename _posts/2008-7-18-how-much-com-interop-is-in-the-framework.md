[Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/) always says that if you have
a question, you should post it on your blog.  So I'm here with a
question and I happen to be posting it on my blog.  I expect Scoble to
go out and find someone to answer it now.  :)

With all the
[talk](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/pdbartlett/archive/2004/02/05/858.aspx)
[about COM](http://news.com.com/2100-1046-5148148.html) and how
Microsoft isn't going to be spending as much money on it as it has in
the past, I got to thinking about how much investment Microsoft already
had in COM and how silly it would be to throw that all away.

I never really thought about it before, but I figure a lot of things COM
are still relied upon pretty heavily in the framework.  My question is
how much stuff in .NET is still COM?  I know System.Web.Mail still
relies on CDONTS or CDOSYS, but as far as anything else goes I have no
clue.

So .NET framework gurus lend me your ears!  How much of .NET still
relies on COM?  Huh?  Don't make me beat it out of ya!
