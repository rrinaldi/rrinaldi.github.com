Last night I updated the site to Community Server 1.1.  The upgrade went
relatively smoothly.  If this post hits the site then all is well with
the MetaBlogApi add-on. 

One of the bugs this upgrade fixes is that now CS honors the Post to
Aggregated Site option in the blog admin.  By default this flag is not
set, so if you want your posts to appear on the aggregated site then you
will need to go in and edit your posts.
