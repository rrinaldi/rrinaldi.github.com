I just noticed that in Community Server 1.1 the “Community
Participation” setting on blog posts default to “Yes”.  If you don’t
wish for your post to be displayed on the main site (if the post is
off-topic, personal, etc.), please make sure to change this setting.

As an aside, it would be really nice if there was a change log that was
publicly available instead of hunting for changes from one version to
the other.
