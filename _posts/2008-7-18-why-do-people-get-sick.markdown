If you've read my blog before, [you would
know](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan/posts/175.aspx) that I spend a lot
of my time volunteering with the [Special
Olympics](http://www.specialolympics.org/).  One of the kids that I work
with was in the hospital for the last couple of weeks (unbeknownst to
me).  He came home the other day.  The doctors say his liver is
failing.  He doesn't have much time to live.

Why does a person who has already had SO many problems in his life, have
to have it end early? Bah.  I take some comfort in the fact that he had
a wonderful summer.  He and his father went to the State Championships
for golf, and he seemed to be loving life.

When you read this, do me a favor and say a little prayer.  You don't
need to say much, just a little “Hey, keep your eyes out for this one. 
He's a keeper.” 

Thanks.
