[jkOnTheRun](http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun) posted about an
article that he wrote over a year ago about his [experiences with a
Hosted Exchange
provider](http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2004/10/hosted_exchange.html). 
I’m posting this up here just in case I decided to go that route, or if
somebody asks me I can point them to this article.
