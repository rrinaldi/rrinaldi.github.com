Go into SQL Query Analyzer, open a new window, drill down to a table in
the object browser, expand a table, drag the Columns folder into the new
window.  A message box will popup that says “No Script Generated”.  Now
expand the columns folder and drag it again.  Now the a comma delimited
list of the columns will be dropped at the cursor location.

Silly huh?
