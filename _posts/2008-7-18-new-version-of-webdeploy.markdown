[Matt](http://weblogs.asp.net/mhawley) has released a [new
version](http://weblogs.asp.net/mhawley/archive/2004/07/26/197599.aspx)
of WebDeploy!  This one includes options for pre and post deploy command
lines and adds anonymous statistic reporting.

I suggest you go ahead and [download
it](http://www.eworldui.net/files/webdeploy/webdeploy.zip) or if you
already have it, just close it open it backup and it will prompt you to
download. :)

[UPDATE]: Matt just IMed to point out you can also click Help -\> “Check
for updates“. :)
