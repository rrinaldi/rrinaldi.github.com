I also expect that branding-wise Windows will remain the foremost brand. I think this is why the .NET brand is already being deprecated. .NET as a brand must fade so it can be reborn like the phoenix in the future - as Windows.</font></p> <br /> <hr /> <font face="Arial" size="2">For more information go to</font> <a title="http://www.lhotka.net" href="http://www.lhotka.net"><font face="Arial" size="2">www.lhotka.net</font></a><font face="Arial" size="2">.</font></div> <br /> <font face="Arial" size="2">[</font><a class="ngquotelink" href="http://www.lhotka.net/WeBlog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=95cadf4f-53bb-4a65-8a2c-45f0fca882cb"><font face="Arial" size="2">Rockford Lhotka</font></a><font face="Arial" size="2">]</font></blockquote>
