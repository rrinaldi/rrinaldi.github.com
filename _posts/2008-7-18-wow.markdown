[I'm flattered.](http://scottwater.com/dottext/posts/9955.aspx)  I
emailed Scott last night to let him know that I found .Text to be a
really cool application, and he posts a link to
[GeekDojo](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/).  So not only is Scott writing
some cool blogging software, but he is also giving out some publicity. 
Cool.
