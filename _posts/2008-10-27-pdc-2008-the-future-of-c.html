<p>(Battery dying, this might be incomplete)</p> <p>December is the 10th anniversary of the inception of C#</p> <p>Some history:</p> <p>1.0: Managed Code</p> <p>2.0 Generics</p> <p>3.0 Language Integrated Query</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Trends that shaped the thinking of C#:</p> <p>Dynamic</p> <p>Declarative</p> <p>Concurrent</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Languages now borrow from each other, nothing is purely dynamic or functional or OO, etc anymore.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Declarative Programming: More that What less of the How.&nbsp; When you state the "What" the framework can take care of the how.</p> <p>Dynamic Languages: You want attributes of both static and dynamic.&nbsp; Dynamic languages can be faster to write, simpler to understand.</p> <p>Concurrency: Moore's Law let us stick our heads in the sand.&nbsp; Time to worry about going parallel.&nbsp; There will be no "/concurrent" switch that can do it.&nbsp; It's hard and you have to think about it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Anders mentioned the Parallel Extensions Framework for .NET.&nbsp; Need to look into this.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>VB versus C#: Co-Evolution. When features are introduced into one language they will work to introduce that into the other.&nbsp; There are no guarantee but they will make sure that the feature isn't "impossible".</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>C# 4.0:</p> <p>Dynamic: Dynamically Typed Objects, Optional and Named Parameters, Improved COM interop, Co and Contra variance. (Yay!)</p> <p>C# and VB will both get support to use the DLR (Dynamic Language Runtime)</p> <p>Binders: Object, Javascript, Python, Ruby and COM. Binders enable C# to talk to Dynamic Languages. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dynamically Typed Objects: "Statically typed to be dynamic" (LOL)</p> <p>Anders: Things should be able to be "dotted into" </p> <p>New psuedo keyword: "dynamic" dynamic i = 42;</p> <p>When operands aare dynamic: Member selection deferred to run-time, at run time actual type(s) substituted for dynamic.</p>
