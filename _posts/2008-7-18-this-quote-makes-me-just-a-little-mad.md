From a [CNN.com
article](http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/biztech/10/05/software.disasters.ap/index.html) on
software disasters:

*"Developers are least qualified to validate a business requirement.
They're either nerds and don't get it, or they're people in another
culture altogether,"* said Michelsen, referring to cases where
development takes place offshore.

The article author puts the second part of that quote in some sort of
context, but dismisses entirely the derogatory nature of the first part.

Oh, and did I mention that the Michelsen above is John Michelsen, chief
executive of iTKO Inc.?  This company sells software the helps companies
manage big software projects. (That info is from the article, for all I
know they sell poop on a stick (I've never heard of 'em))  I'm curious
as to what the "nerds" that work for that company think of their chief
executive?
