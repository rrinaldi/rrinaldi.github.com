Being easily swayed by peer pressure,
[Jeff](http://weblogs.asp.net/jkey)convinced me to get on the GTD
(Getting Things Done!, for those 3 people that have yet to hear about
it) band wagon.  He promised me that if I jumped on board, I would be
shown a life where woman flock to me and men tremble in fear at the
mention of my name.  Well that never happened, but my productivity has
improved and my stress has gone down considerably.  In case anybody is
curious, I thought I would outline some of the tools/books I’ve bought
that helps make my life a tad bit sweeter:

-   [Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free
    Productivity](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0142000280/102-0530815-1905718?v=glance):
    The book on Getting Things Done (hence the title!)  I’ve read about
    half of it so far, and it’s already making a HUGE difference.
-   [Take Back Your Life!: Using Microsoft Outlook to Get Organized and
    Stay
    Organized](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735620407/102-0530815-1905718?v=glance):This
    book has the exact same concepts (I heard a rumour that these two
    authors/speakers/consultants used to work together).  Reading it
    along with the book above really helps to drive home the concepts of
    GTD
-   [Getting Things Done! Outlook
    Add-in](http://www.davidco.com/products.php#): Picked this guy up
    not too long ago, and using it to keep my inbox free of “open-loops”
    has been great.  It makes Delegating, Deferring and Deleting a
    breeze.  Highly recommended.
-   [LookOut! Outlook
    Search](http://www.lookoutsoft.com/Lookout/download.html): I know
    most people have moved on to MSN Desktop Search or Google’s search,
    but I still prefer using LookOut.  You can still download it from
    the original site.
