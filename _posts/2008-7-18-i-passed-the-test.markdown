So I have this new budget setup right?  Got Microsoft Money 2004 (which
rocks BTW, I will write a review as soon as I spend some more time with
it (Get it? Spend?  HAHA, I crack myself up)) running, budget budgeting,
accounts accounting, cash flow forecasts forecasting and then my
wonderful roommate, [Andy](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/andy), needs a ride
to the two pillars of geekdom: BestBuy and MicroCenter.  Just hearing
the names of those two wonderful stores starts my salivary glands up. 
Going there causes me to go into some sort of trance, like a drug crazed
trip through heaven.

Well, normally it would.  But this time, I couldn't let myself spend a
dime.  You know, I have a BUDGET now and that BUDGET means that I can't
do squat.  So I became a fiscally conservative geek and perused the
aisles imagining what it would be like to have another 100 feet of CAT 5
cable, or a 6 port USB hub or any random piece of useless geekery.

I was able to walk away from both places without spending a dime.

I win.
