<P>I don't like databases any more.&nbsp; I'm tired of them.&nbsp; They just don't do it for me any more.</P> <P>In my opinion (which means you should probably ignore it), database tools&nbsp;just don't make sense in enterprise development today.</P> <P>"Blasphemy!", you shout.</P> <P>Hear me out for a second.&nbsp; I'm not saying you shouldn't use them, or that there is some other magical solution for storing data that is better.&nbsp; I'm saying that the way we work with them doesn't match the way you work with all of the other tools that you use.</P> <P>Lets say you are given a new feature request to work on.&nbsp; One of the first things you do is create a new branch in source control.&nbsp; You start hacking away at your code, until you realize that there is a need to add a new field to the database.&nbsp; Right away there is a problem.&nbsp; Do you add the field to a shared development database?&nbsp; Well, if you do you have no control over the state of the server.&nbsp; It could be up, it could be down.&nbsp; That's no good.&nbsp; So you add the field to your own personal development database.&nbsp; That works pretty well.&nbsp; You have control over the state of the server, you know that when a query doesn't return right away it's because you screwed up and not another developer.&nbsp; All in all it seems like a good solution.</P> <P>So you go hacking away at the code, adding new fields to the database, add a couple new procedures, change some other ones and add a few views.&nbsp; Some time passes and now it's time to promote your new feature to QA.&nbsp; So you merge your code back in, and up pops a window so you can manually merge in some changes that are conflicting but for the most part all of your changes were automatically merged in.&nbsp; Now comes the time to update that QA database.&nbsp; What changed from your version to the one in QA?&nbsp; How many new fields have been added?&nbsp; How many procedures have been changed?&nbsp; Have fun finding out, since it's mostly a manual process.&nbsp; It's error prone and, quite frankly, scary.&nbsp; I know I hate it.</P> <P>What I want is to see a system that can branch and merge database schema integrated directly into the tools that come with SQL Server (whether that is Enterprise Manager or SQL Workbench (whatever it is called in 2005)).&nbsp; Is that asking a lot?&nbsp; Yeah, but I think it's about time.</P> <P>Maybe I'm a dreamer, but I know I'm not the only one. :P</P>
