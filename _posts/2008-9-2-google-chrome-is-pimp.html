What could they possibly bring to the table?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Apparently they bring to the table a metric shit ton of computer-y science people that reinvent "fast" when it comes to JavaScript execution and html rendering.&nbsp; Besides blazing fast JavaScript-ness they also bring (my favs):</p> <p>- Tear away tabs:</p> <blockquote> <p>Grab a tab.&nbsp; Drag it out of the window.&nbsp; New window. </p> <p>Grab the tab from the new window. Drag it back to the old window.&nbsp; </p> <p>How awesome is that?</p></blockquote> <p>- Default home page</p> <blockquote> <p>Love the fact that they show me screen-shots of the sites I visit most.&nbsp; My problem with setting a homepage (or favorites) is that I have to *remember* the exist and update them when my tastes change.&nbsp; Chrome will notice that I don't go to the same sites anymore and slowly show me sites I visit more often.&nbsp; That is *hot*.</p></blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Anyway, go download it.&nbsp; It is totally worth checking out.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:b6f5e7b6-6cf2-4a12-ae5c-fb81e3bafa6e" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/chrome" rel="tag">chrome</a></div></p>
