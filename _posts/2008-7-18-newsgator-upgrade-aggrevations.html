<P>NewsGator sent me an email today explaining how I should upgrade to the latest and greatest version of their software.&nbsp; I've been putting off the upgrade for awhile now since I've heard tons of complaints about the new version, but those complaints have died down and I've been hearing good things again.&nbsp; So I download the new "Outlook Edition" and run through the setup.&nbsp; I then proceed to open up Outlook and then I see nothing.&nbsp; No NewsGator.&nbsp; w00t.</P> <P>"No worries", I think. "I'll just head over to the support site."</P> <P>On the support site I find a <A href="http://newsgator.mykbpro.com/Article_2CBAA.aspx">knowledge base article</A> that would seem to help.&nbsp; I try both of the ideas listed in the article.&nbsp; One required a registry tweak and the other had me validate that NewsGator was not disabled by Outlook.&nbsp; It's a pretty quick check so I followed the directions:</P> <P>- Go to Help | About MS Office Outlook</P> <P>- Click the [Disabled Items] button and if NewsGator is listed</P> <P>- If it is, select it and click the [Enable] button</P> <P>- Restart Outlook</P> <P>Well, NewsGator didn't show up disabled so I was out of luck.&nbsp; I then decided to shoot an email off to support:</P> <P>"NewsGator is not loading when outlook starts up.&nbsp; I already tried both of the ideas listed here: <A title=http://newsgator.mykbpro.com/Article_2CBAA.aspx href="http://newsgator.mykbpro.com/article_2cbaa.aspx">http://newsgator.mykbpro.com/Article_2CBAA.aspx</A>&nbsp;</P> <P>and here is the output of NewsGator diagnostics:</P> <P>[diagnostics removed for brevity]"</P> <P>So a few hours go by and I receive an email back:</P> <P>"If the NewsGator button is missing:</P> <P>- Go to Help | About MS Office Outlook</P> <P>- Click the [Disabled Items] button and if NewsGator is listed</P> <P>- If it is, select it and click the [Enable] button</P> <P>- Restart Outlook</P> <P>Regards,</P> <P>[Name withheld]"</P> <P>Okay.&nbsp; WTF.&nbsp; Did this person even read my email?&nbsp; Talk about exasperating.</P> <P>Why even bother to have customer service and support when the person doesn't take the time to even try to help?&nbsp; The other frustrating part of this email is that the author didn't leave the communication open.&nbsp; There is no "I hope this helps" or "If you have any questions, please let me know.".&nbsp; That's important!&nbsp; Rattling off some knowledge base entry and then saying "Good bye" isn't any better than a bot.</P> <P>I'm off to try to figure out what the heck happened to my NewsGator and if I can't get this resolved soon I guess I'm going to have to find another RSS aggregator.</P>
