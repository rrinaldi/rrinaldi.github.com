[kbAlertz.com](http://www.kbalertz.com/) has created [RSS
feeds](http://kbalertz.mykb.com/Article_834DA.aspx) of Microsoft's
Knowledge Base on a per category basis.

If your not familiar with kbAlertz, they scan the MS KB and create a
listing of all new knowledge base entries.  You can sign up to be
emailed all the updates (or subscribe through RSS) to the
categories that interest you.  All the categories correspond with
Microsoft technologies and/or products. 

While this service from kbAlertz is great, why did they have to do it? 
Microsoft really dropped the ball on this one. 
[Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/) has been ranting and raving
about RSS for a long time. You would figure that somebody over there
would think that the Knowledge base was a good candidate for RSS.
