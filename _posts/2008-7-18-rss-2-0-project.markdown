Andrew Connell pointed out that CodeProject.com has a [RSS 2.0 framework
project](http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/rssframework.asp):

> RSS 2.0 framework implements the RSS 2.0 specification in strongly
> typed classes. The framework enables you to create and consume valid
> RSS 2.0 feeds in your code in just a few minutes.

I have to point out [RSS.NET](http://rss-net.sourceforge.net/):

> RSS.NET is an open-source .NET class library for RSS feeds. It
> provides a reusable object model for parsing and writing RSS feeds. It
> is fully compatible with RSS versions 0.90, 0.91, 0.92, and 2.0.1,
> implementing all constructs.

I believe it has flown under the radar because it has a very, very hard
to search name
