<p>From JK from <a href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/">jkontherun.com</a>: <a href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2005/11/is_slashdot_sti.html">Is Slashdot still relevant?</a></p> <p>Slashdot was removed from my aggregator a long time ago.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s too far behind the buzz that already out in the blogosphere and the quality of the commentary is quite poor.&nbsp; I really can&rsquo;t have a conversation with anybody that has is a zealot or their last opinion of Windows was from 1996.</p>
