<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/mhawley">Matt Hawley</a> has been doing some real crazy things with Web Deploy.&nbsp; He is <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/mhawley/archive/2004/07/15/184492.aspx">putting in file masks</a>, added some different backup options and all in all creating a really, really cool tool.&nbsp; This is definitely one that I can't live without any more.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As an aside, I think everybody should know that Matt is really working hard on Web Deploy and could really use your feedback.&nbsp; Let him know if you use it, why you use it, how you use it and if you don't use it, why not? :)</font></p>
