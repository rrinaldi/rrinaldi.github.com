Since Windows 95 came out, I have wanted one thing.  Let me arrange the
taskbar as I see fit.  I like having all the little programs down there
in a certain order, and when something crashes (like, for instance,
Outlook) and I restart it, I want it to be the first thing on the
taskbar.  Now that Longhorn is going to be coming out with its 3d
enhanced, super uber graphics, and vectorized icons you would think that
I would be able to grab a running program on the taskbar, and drag it to
where I (ME, THE USER) would want it (CAUSE I WANT IT THERE).  So here's
hoping (\*crossing fingers\*).
