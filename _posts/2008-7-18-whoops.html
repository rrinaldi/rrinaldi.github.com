<P>Looks like the registration slipped for the Dojo!&nbsp; Sorry about that!&nbsp; All seems to be back to normal again. (At least DNS seems to have propagated correctly to the South Loop in Chicago)</P> <P>As an FYI to all y'all, if I have a few spare cycles this weekend, I'll be upgrading the dojo yet again but this time it will be to CS 2.1.</P>
