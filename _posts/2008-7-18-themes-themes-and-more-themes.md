So I've been using this [MCE
theme](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan/archive/2004/06/30/2356.aspx) for
the past day, and I have to say I really love it.  My only problem is
that it's the only "official" theme I've seen come from Microsoft and
I'm using the term official quite loosely since the theme was never
intended to be used on anything but MCE.  MS went through all this
trouble to write a theme engine for XP and then they never release any
themes?  What's up with that?  I've been told that there are some in the
XP Plus pack but there aren't enough to justify buying it.  So why won't
MS release more?  Are they worried about putting some small ISV out of
business?
