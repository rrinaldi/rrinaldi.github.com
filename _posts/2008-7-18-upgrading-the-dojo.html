<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Just so the fellow bloggers here know, I am currently looking into what it would take to upgrade thee <a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/">dojo</a> to <a href="http://www.communityserver.org/">Community Server</a>.&nbsp; So far it seems the upgrade path is a little rocky for community sites, so until some kinks get worked out&nbsp;I'm a little hesitant.&nbsp;I might be waiting for a version 1.1.&nbsp; If anybody has any opinions on the matter, please please please contact me.&nbsp; I'm open to any and all ideas.</font></p>
