<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Not if you bound it at least once.</font></p> <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">I found this little bug the other day.&nbsp; I don't know if I'm the first, but I figured I would throw it out here so Google can reel it in for someone else.</font></p> <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">If you bind a DataGrid to a collection that has at least 1 (one) item in it, the Items.Count property mirrors the count of the items in the collection.&nbsp; If you remove all the items from the collection and rebind, the Items.Count property will be 1 (one) while the count of the items in the collection will be 0 (zero).&nbsp; You add one to the collection, rebind, and the Items.Count will still be 1 (one).</font></p> <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Pretty silly huh?</font></p> <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">I don't write bug free code (as evidence to that fact was the rollout I did last week (by far my&nbsp;worst rollout ever!)) so I feel kind of weird complaining about it but that seems like something that should have been caught back in testing.</font></p>
