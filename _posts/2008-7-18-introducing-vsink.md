I saw [this
post](http://journals.tuxreports.com/lch/archives/002765.html) by the
Incremental Blogger explaining some ideas for integrating ink with
Visual Studio.  After reading the post, I thought “Gotta have it!  Must
have it!  Where’s the install?”.  After realizing that his post was just
a teaser and he hadn’t released anything, I figured I would write it
myself.  I decided to write it as a CodeRush plugin, since the CodeRush
API is SO much sweeter than the VS Add-In API.  Here is a screen shot:

Right now it has the following features:

-   Multiple colored ink
-   Select and Resize ink strokes
-   Saving and loading of ink.
-   3 different pen sizes
-   Erasing ink

Since I don’t have a tablet, I haven’t been able to actually test it
with a Tablet PC, so I’m looking for somebody to try it out and let me
know how it goes.

Oh and to answer a question I got a lot when showing it to friends: Yes,
the ink scrolls relative to the code.  You scroll down, it goes up, you
scroll up, it goes down. It’s actually quite cool.  If there is a lot of
interest, I’ll probably tidy it up and release the code.

I’m going to spend a little bit of time this week and finish testing
it.  I’ll probably release it later this week or early next week.  When
I do, please keep in mind that this is more of a “Concept Application”
and less “Enterprise quality, mission critical application”.  So don’t
blame me if it kicks your dog.  I tried to warn you.
