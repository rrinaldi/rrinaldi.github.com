[Rory](http://neopoleon.com/blog/) put some fine thought into his [ASS
protocol](http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/1624.aspx).  But he forgot one
thing.  His protocol displays “Y” in the body of the ASS feed.  I, for
one, believe that “Y” stands as an equal to the other, more famous,
vowels and should be recognized. 

So therefore I propose a new updated ASS protocol: ASS v1.0.3.14  better
known as ASS:SY (Another Simple Syndication: Sometimes Y extension).  I
know that ASS was created to end the ATOM versus RSS debate, but it is
apparent to this blogger that Rory did not fully consider the problem
domain. 

ASS:SY will use AI to determine the intent of the letter “Y“ in each
word that it appears.  If the “Y“ is being used as a vowel, then the “Y“
should be removed also.  This might increase the overhead of creating an
ASS:SY feed, but I feel the Sometimes Y extension allows for a more
concise (and therefore smaller and more lightweight) feed.
