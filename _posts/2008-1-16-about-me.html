I'm a Software Architect at Trading Technologies on their Enterprise Development team.&nbsp; Most of my work is spent writing internal line of business applications with the occasional work on internal tooling.&nbsp; I'm a big fan of writing/creating developer tools and decreasing developer friction.</p>
