If you found yourself here via my RSS feed, then the redirect module I
put up on my old blog is working.

 

For anybody interested in the technical details, I installed an [HTTP
Module](http://weblogs.asp.net/fmarguerie/archive/2004/11/18/265719.aspx)
that does 301/302 redirects based on the URL you are navigating to.  I
have my old RSS and Atom feeds redirected to my FeedBurner URL, also I
parsed my BlogML file to get the URLs from my old site and convert them
into the format of my new site.  All in all, it seems to be working
quite well. I'm sure there are some URLs that didn't map properly but
that is something that I'll fix as I find them.
