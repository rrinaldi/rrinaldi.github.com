With 14 posts in under 24 hours I hearby proclaim [Adam
Field](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/adam) the new
[Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/).

At the very least, he is challenging the link-o-rama legend himself. 
With Scoble's new self imposed 6 entry daily limit, Adam has the
possibility to overtake him.  At the very least, it might overtake the
dojo's server. :)

But could this be true?  Could one man possibly have enough endurance to
create more links then Scoble?  Only time will tell.  Until then, the
battle continues...

[Okay, I'm done with the stupid blogosphere commentary.  At least I
thought it was funny. :)]
