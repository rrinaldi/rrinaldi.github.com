<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Friday I sat down and watched &#8220;</FONT><A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130827/"><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Run Lola Run</FONT></A><FONT face=Verdana size=2>&#8221;, a great flick if enjoy watching people play with time. :) The plot is outlined simply as &#8220;Lola runs. To save her boyfriend's life.&#8220;</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>I know I'm late to the party, seeing how this movie was released in 1998, but if you like foreign films with a sweet techno/trance soundtrack take some time and watch it.  It won't take long since the movie is only 80 minutes.</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>FYI: Don't watch this movie if you don't like subtitles or voice dubbing.  Also, don't watch it if you don't want to think.  It doesn't make you think like the Matrix does, but it will at least make you say &#8220;huh?&#8221;.</FONT></P>
