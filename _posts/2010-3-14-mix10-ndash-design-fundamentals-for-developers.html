<p>Just arrived in my first workshop. (And yes, I was able to knock the cobwebs loose and I remembered which workshops I signed up for!)</p>  <p>Presentation is by Robby Ingebretsen – Created <a href="http://www.kaxaml.com/">KAXAML</a></p>  <p>-----</p>  <p>Design is everywhere and design touches everything. The process of design is the process of creating.</p>  <p>We all need to consider the implications of design.</p>  <p>If you create things, you design them.</p>  <p>Stop evaluating yourself as a developer versus designer.&#160; Just be both.</p>  <p>Time for us to get Smart about design</p>  <li>Improve design vocab </li>  <li>Add to design knowledge </li>  <li>Increase design confidence    <p>Design </p>    <ul>     <li>Design is order </li>      <li>The more “invisible” the design the better the design is </li>      <li>Design should “fad away” </li>      <li>Design is problem solving </li>   </ul>    <p>Check out the book “How to Think Like a Great Graphic Designer”.</p> </li>  <p>Be empathetic.&#160; Put yourself in end users shoes.&#160; It allows you to communicate with them in more effective ways.</p>  <p>Art has a subjective goal.&#160; It is something that you want to make.</p>  <p>Design has an objective goal. You are trying to create something that solves a problem.</p>  <p>Design by</p>  <ul>   <li>Process</li>    <li>People</li>    <li>Synthesis</li> </ul>  <p>Creative process is really 2 things: Flow and Edit</p>  <p>First part of flow is research.</p>  <p>After research is brainstorming</p>  <ul>   <li>Apple uses a 10/3/1 rule</li>    <ul>     <li>Come up with 10 pixel perfect designs</li>      <li>Choose 3</li>      <li>Refine those 3</li>      <li>Choose 1</li>   </ul> </ul>  <p>“Babies” and “Ponies”</p>  <ul>   <li>“Babies” -&#160; Don’t fall in love with designs that you spend a lot of time on if they don’t solve the problem</li>    <li>“Ponies” – Things that stakeholders want that don’t add to the design.</li> </ul>  <p>Process docs</p>  <ul>   <li>Brief</li>    <ul>     <li>Kick off a project</li>      <li>Spec</li>   </ul>    <li>Pitch</li>    <ul>     <li>A first response to the creative brief</li>      <li>In the end you need to land on a direction to go</li>   </ul>    <li>Wireframe/Sketch</li>    <ul>     <li>Describes the Information architecture</li>      <li>layout</li>      <li>Navigation</li>      <li>user flow</li>      <li>high level information structure</li>   </ul>    <li>Interaction Spec</li>    <ul>     <li>Doc that describes how people will interact between the design and observer</li>   </ul>    <li>Motion guide</li>    <ul>     <li>a guide to the personality and tone of the of the animation and movement in the application</li>   </ul>    <li>Comp</li>    <ul>     <li>establish the final visual design</li>   </ul>    <li>Prototype</li>    <ul>     <li>a complete or semi-complete sample of the final design</li>   </ul> </ul>  <p>Love the quote “Saul Bass is awesome” :P</p>  <p>“Anybody in the room can be a great designer, err at least a passable one” – At least he is honest!</p>  <p>The trick to being a great designer is:</p>  <ul>   <li>Hard work</li>    <li>Observe the world around you synthesize it.</li> </ul>  <p>-----</p>  <p>More after the break. :)</p>
