Got a question to throw out there:

If you could only go to one conference, and you could choose between the
[.NET
Campsight](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/campsightserver.aspx) (Training
from the big hitters in the industry) or
[PDC](http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/) (ohh, shiny!), which one
would you go to?  I already know where I would go, but I'm just curious
as to how other people would decide and how they came to that decision.
