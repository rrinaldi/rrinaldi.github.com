Note to self: Never, ever, ever use the last pair of contacts without
having a box of new contacts ready to go.  My old glasses are a couple
prescriptions out of date and causing great aches of the head. :(

Also, contacts like to jump from your hand into oblivion.  Apparently
they take up residence with the socks from the dryer.
