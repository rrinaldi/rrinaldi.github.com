<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well, approximately one year ago thee ol' Geekdojo went live.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, I have no idea&nbsp;when the first post was made to the site.&nbsp; I accidentally&nbsp;toasted the database on an upgrade gone bad. Whoops.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The site started with 4 bloggers (Andy, <a title="" href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/jez" >Ray</a>, Richard and me), and slowly we expanded to&nbsp;the 19 that we have currently.&nbsp; I'm quite impressed with how this thing took off.&nbsp;&nbsp;We could always have some more bloggers, but I kinda want the dojo to be more than that.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is, what should we do?&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; Community site?&nbsp; Forums? A portal of some kind?&nbsp; I know people out there have some ideas but they don't have a server, or&nbsp;bandwidth, or they can't find people that would help out.&nbsp; Well, I have all of that! :)</font></p>
