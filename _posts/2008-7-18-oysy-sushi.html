<P>If you ever find yourself hankering for some sushi and you happen to be in Chicago's south loop, I would highly recommend <A href="http://www.oysysushi.com/">Oysy Sushi</A> at Michigan and 9th.&nbsp; <A href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/richard">Richard </A>turned me onto the place about 6 months ago or so and I've always been very impressed with the quality of the sushi and the excellent service.&nbsp; The wonderful part is that I've been there quite a few times and I've never had to wait for a table, so I think it is still undiscovered.&nbsp; I'm hesitant to even talk about the it because I don't want to wind up waiting for a table the next time I head over there.&nbsp; :)</P><P>Technorati Tags : <A href="http://technorati.com/tag/Sushi" target=_blank rel=tag>Sushi</A>, <A href="http://technorati.com/tag/Chicago" target=_blank rel=tag>Chicago</A><!-- End Technorati Tags --></P>
