<p>If you found yourself here via my RSS feed, then the redirect module I put up on my old blog is working.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>For anybody interested in the technical details, I installed an <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/fmarguerie/archive/2004/11/18/265719.aspx">HTTP Module</a> that does 301/302 redirects based on the URL you are navigating to.&nbsp; I have my old RSS and Atom feeds redirected to my FeedBurner URL, also I parsed my BlogML file to get the URLs from my old site and convert them into the format of my new site.&nbsp; All in all, it seems to be working quite well. I'm sure there are some URLs that didn't map properly but that is something that I'll fix as I find them.</p>
