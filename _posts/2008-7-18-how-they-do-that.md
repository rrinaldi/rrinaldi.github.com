If you ever wondered how some of the standard .NET classes do the voodoo
that they do, now you can find out.  Check out
[Reflector](http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/) for .NET.  From the
site:

“Reflector is a class browser, decompiler and XML documentation browser
for .NET components (assemblies). It features assembly and namespace
views, type and member search, reference search, IL disassembler, C\#
decompiler, VB decompiler, C\# XML documentation viewer, MSDN help
viewer, dependency trees, supertype/subtype hierarchies and resource
viewers. Function prototypes are displayed in C\# and VB syntax.”
