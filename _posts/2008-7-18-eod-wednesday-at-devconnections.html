<DIV>Today the session quality was "iffy".&nbsp; I wound up leaving a few early, normally because the presenter named his or her session poorly.&nbsp; Please people if you are going to be presenting on a topic name your presentations correctly.&nbsp; If you are going to be showing an overview of a technology, don't call it "Developing with Technology X" call it an overview.&nbsp; Please don't name your sessions things like "Indigo says Hi!" or "You, ASP.NET and Me".&nbsp; WTF?&nbsp; How am I supposed to figure out what that&nbsp;session is about?&nbsp; It might be great, or it might be boring.&nbsp; My work spent good money to get me out here, and I'm not going to take a stab in the dark.&nbsp; If I can't figure out what the session is, I'm not going.&nbsp; Simple.&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>On another note, the people in charge seem to realize that giving 3000 people 30 minutes to travel a half a mile to the expo area and back for a break is braindead.&nbsp; They moved the refreshments this afternoon to the hallway outside the sessions.&nbsp; Good move!</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>This evening I'm going out for a little night on the town.&nbsp; I'll probably start with some craps at Mandalay, but later on I'm going to see Avenue Q with my buddy Richard (who also was able to con work into sending him out here).</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Technorati Tags : <A href="http://technorati.com/tag/DevConnections" target=_blank rel=tag>DevConnections</A><!-- End Technorati Tags --></DIV>
