<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Got a question to throw out there:</font></p> <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you could only go to one conference, and you could choose between the <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/campsightserver.aspx">.NET Campsight</a>&nbsp;(Training from the big&nbsp;hitters in the industry)&nbsp;or <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/">PDC</a>&nbsp;(ohh, shiny!), which one would you go to?&nbsp; I already know where I would go, but I'm just curious as to how other people would decide and how they came to that decision.</font></p>
