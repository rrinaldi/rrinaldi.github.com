[Scripting.com](http://scripting.com/) has posted a
[SDK](http://feeds.scripting.com/sdk) for it's new [Share Your
OPML](http://feeds.scripting.com/) site.  I would really like to see
some aggregators include some functionality that automagically updates
feeds.scripting.com whenever you add a new feed.  This functionality
isn't available yet from the SDK, it only allows you read access to the
information, which is a huge limitation IMHO.  Good data is essential
for this to get off the ground and they need to make it butt simple to
update it.

[UPDATE: [Steve
Maine](http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,dbf1adbc-2971-4df5-adbd-8057414cc096.aspx)
has some great ideas that we could use this SDK for.]
