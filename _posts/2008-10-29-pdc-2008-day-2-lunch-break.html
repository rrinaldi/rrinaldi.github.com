<p>Taking a quick break to install Vista SP1.&nbsp; I'm prepping my machine to install Win7 and VS2010 because I'm apparently certifiably insane (so says Ray and Richard).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Parallel Framework stuff I saw in the last session is incredibly sweet.&nbsp; The lightweight Tasks are pure genius and Parallel LINQ is so silly easy I would find it hard to not use.&nbsp; While that is easy to say now since I have yet to actually play with it, but from the demo there are very little new concepts that you have to learn and the framework allows scaling to <em>n </em>number of cores simple.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>After my little lunch break here I'm heading over to "Oslo" : Customizing and Extending the Visual Design Experience.</p>
