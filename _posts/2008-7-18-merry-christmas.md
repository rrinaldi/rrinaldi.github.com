Merry Christmas to one and all!  I hope Santa brought you everything you
wanted.  As for me?  This year my two favorite gifts are my new [Home
Cafe brewing system from Black and Decker](http://shrinkster.com/2vn)
and of course, Halo 2!  I'll be wooping some a\$\$ on XBox live in the
next couple days.  See you there!
