<p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the office I have multiple monitors and I downloaded the king of all multiple monitor utilities UltraMon.&nbsp; Today while surfing I stumbled across <a href="http://www.digitaltigers.com/index.shtml">Digital Tigers</a>, a company that markets multiple monitors that are hooked up to appear as one monitor.&nbsp; While surfing the site, I found this: <a href="http://www.digitaltigers.com/tigervista_manager.shtml">TigerVista Manager</a>, which is nothing more the a rebranding of UltraMon!&nbsp;&nbsp; Take a look at <a href="http://www.realtimesoft.com/ultramon/tour/">this site</a> and you'll see that they are completely identical.&nbsp; It's cool and all if UltraMon sold Digital Tigers the software, but on the Digital Tigers site they proclaim that TigerVista Manager is exclusive software and only available direct from them. :(</font></p>
