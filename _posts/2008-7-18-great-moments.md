If you have some free time, I suggest you go and check out [Microsoft's
new ad
campaign](http://www.microsoft.com/office/greatmoments/ads_tv.asp).  How
did Microsoft know that every time I print out a spreadsheet I'm just
waiting to be tackled by fellow office workers and have water poured
over me?  I always thought that paper pushing should be an Olympic
sport, and now Microsoft agrees with me.  It's so good to be right.
