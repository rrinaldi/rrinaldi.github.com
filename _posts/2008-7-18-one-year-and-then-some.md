Well, approximately one year ago thee ol' Geekdojo went live.  Sadly, I
have no idea when the first post was made to the site.  I
accidentally toasted the database on an upgrade gone bad. Whoops.

The site started with 4 bloggers (Andy,
[Ray](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/jez), Richard and me), and slowly we
expanded to the 19 that we have currently.  I'm quite impressed with how
this thing took off.  We could always have some more bloggers, but I
kinda want the dojo to be more than that.  The question is, what should
we do?  Any ideas?  Community site?  Forums? A portal of some kind?  I
know people out there have some ideas but they don't have a server,
or bandwidth, or they can't find people that would help out.  Well, I
have all of that! :)
