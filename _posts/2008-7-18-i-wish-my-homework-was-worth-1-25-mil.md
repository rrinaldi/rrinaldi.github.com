Adil Lalani did his homework.

That homework turned into a web app that he [sold for \$1.25
mil](http://www.eschoolnews.com/news/showStory.cfm?ArticleID=5924) in
cash and stock and he will become an employee of the company that bought
his application when he graduates.

And who says the bubble isn’t returning?
