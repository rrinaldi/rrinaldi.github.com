After DevDays (which I wasn't lucky enough to attend) a [gaggle of
geeks](http://weblogs.asp.net/mhawley/archive/2004/03/11/87955.aspx) (which
I was lucky enough to attend) got together for some talking, eating,
drinking and general merrymaking.  The sad part was that out of the 6
people that showed up, only 2 were from Chicago proper ([Jeff
Key](http://weblogs.asp.net/jkey) and I).  Jeff and I got to talking and
came to the conclusion that Chicago needs to represent.  So I'm looking
for people that would be interested in doing a semi-regular geek
dinner/get together/party/event thing.  We could do these on a Saturday
so we could get some people to come into the city from the greater
Chicagoland area.  And I don't know about you, but my work schedule
makes it practically impossible to do anything on a weeknight.

This is completely non-committal at this point in time. I'm just
floating an idea out to see if there would be interest.

If this takes off, maybe we could even formalize it into a user group of
sorts. (Before the Chicago .NET user group gets mad at me: It's not that
I don't like you, it's that you have meetings on weeknights at 6 o'clock
30 miles outside the city which makes it practically impossible for me
or most city dwellers to get out there especially since most of the guys
I know don't have cars.)

So are there any takers?  Either drop me a line in the comments section,
or use the spiffy "Contact" link at the top left of the page.
