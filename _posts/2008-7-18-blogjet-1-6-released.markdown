[BlogJet](http://blogjet.com/) 1.6 has been released and this version
adds some features that I’ve been waiting for:

-   [Free Flickr integration
    plugin](http://www.blogjet.com/blog/2005/11/28/blogjet-flickr-and-other-new-features/)
    (included, no installation required).
-   [Auto
    Replace](http://www.blogjet.com/blog/2005/11/18/new-feature-in-the-upcoming-release/).
-   [*Title* and *rel* attributes for
    links](http://www.blogjet.com/blog/2005/11/30/advanced-insert-link-window-in-the-upcoming-version/).
-   [Ping default
    URLs](http://www.blogjet.com/blog/2005/11/29/ping-default-urls-feature-in-the-upcoming-version/).
-   [Protection for unsaved posts before
    publishing](http://www.blogjet.com/blog/2005/11/22/protection-for-your-work/).
-   [Zoom icon for generated
    thumbnails](http://www.blogjet.com/blog/2005/11/28/blogjet-flickr-and-other-new-features/).
-   [Saving of default layout settings for Insert Image
    window](http://www.blogjet.com/blog/2005/11/28/blogjet-flickr-and-other-new-features/).
-   Group posting (post to multiple blogs at once).
-   Confirm when using Ctrl+Enter to publish post.
-   Better FTP file upload progress indication.
-   New blog providers: [Blogzerk](http://blogzerk.com/) and
    [BLOGZY](http://blogzy.com/).
-   NTLM and Digest proxy authorization support.
-   New keyboard shortcut: \
     Ctrl+Y - edit last post\
     Ctrl+Shift+E - extended entry
-   Ability to abort posting when checking spelling.
-   BlogJetThis extension for Firefox 1.5.
-   Speed and stability improvements.

The big features for me are the Auto Replace (which was supported in
.Text, but was ripped out of Community Server.  I know Paul really
missed that.  This might bring his “bliki” back to life.), Ping default
URLs and the the title and rel attributes for links.
