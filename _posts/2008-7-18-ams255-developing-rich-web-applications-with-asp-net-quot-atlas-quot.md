Again, I'm late to a session.  They have got to move the break
area/lunch area closer to the sessions!
 
Looks like I didn't miss much right now.  The presenter is going into
the definition of AJAX and explaining how you can use it to make your UI
more interactive but there isn't any new information yet.

Atlas
- A framework for building richer, more interactive, more personalized
web experiences
- high productivity
- full extensibility
- works everywhere
- runs in IE, Firefox and Safari
 
The presenter is showing a "What is Atlas" diagram and it is by far the
most confusing diagram I've seen so far today.
 
Powerful Client Framework
- Atlas script core - A full Javascript type system
     - Classes, namespaces, interfaces and enums
     - Multi-cast event handlers similiar to .NET
     - Enriched tools support in Visual Studio "Orcas"
- Base Class Library
     - Hleper classes, extension to existing types
     - Debugging and tracing, networking
- Component and control model
    - Easy to compose, connect and reuse
    - Visual and Non-Visual items
 
Seamless server access
- Easy access to server components
     - ASMX and WCF services
     - .NET Components (?)
     - Components and methods on ASP.NET pages
- Automatic proxy generation, object serialization
- Use ASP.NET application services from script
      - Authentication and Roles
      - Roaming user profiles and UI personalization
      - Sessions state and cacheing
 
In the demo the "Atlas"-ified web service was just demoed showing how to
get a javascript proxy to the web service.  That really has a wow
effect.
 
Seems pretty neat so far, but I don't get why you would want to get data
from the server then spend all these cycles to dynamically create all
the layout on the client.  It has to be easier than that.
 
Enabling the "Programmable Web"
- Produce services, not only markup
- Easily consume services and data
- Goal: Enable interesting reuse scenarios 
 
Enriched ASP.NET pages and controls
- Enhance user experience of any page or control
       - Fewer postabacks, greater interactivity
- Server support for Atlas client framework
- Core Controls will use Atlas in v.Next
 
This session is really a more "Introduction to Atlas".  Calling it
"Developing ..." is really a misnomer.  I think I might bail on this
one.  Not the way I wanted to end my day.   I was hoping to go out on a
good note. :(
