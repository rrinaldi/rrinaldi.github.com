Just so the fellow bloggers here know, I am currently looking into what
it would take to upgrade thee [dojo](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/) to
[Community Server](http://www.communityserver.org/).  So far it seems
the upgrade path is a little rocky for community sites, so until some
kinks get worked out I'm a little hesitant. I might be waiting for a
version 1.1.  If anybody has any opinions on the matter, please please
please contact me.  I'm open to any and all ideas.
