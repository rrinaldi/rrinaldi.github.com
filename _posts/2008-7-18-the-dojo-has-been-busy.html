<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">Hey! I knew there was something that I was forgetting to do!  Write in the blog.</font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">Sorry for the lack of updates lately, but all of us members in the Dojo have been quite busy.</font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2"><a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/richard">Richard</a>, <a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/jez">Ray</a> and I just finished a HUGE data migration ASP.NET rewrite at work.</font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2"><a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/andy">Andy</a> is in the middle of mid-terms. (Young whippersnapper)</font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">and there was this little matter of the Cubs playing in October in the post-season.  See, I'm what people call a Die-Hard Fan.  Season ticket holder, born and raised on the Chicago Cubs (brainwashed by my wonderful mother).  I wish there was some pill I could take so I wouldn't give a damn, but that thought is more of pipe dream than anything.</font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">Hopefully I will have some pictures to post of the craziness that was Game 6 and Game 7.  </font></p>
