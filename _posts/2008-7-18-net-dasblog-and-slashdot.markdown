[Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) has a [good
writeup](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=f19a277c-8c9d-4af9-bf99-add650288055)
covering the Slashdotting that he received.

From what I've always read Slashdotting seems to occur when you are
limited by one of the following:

-   Small pipe
-   Large downloads
-   Underpowered webserver

As long as you're only serving HTML, have a decent machine, and have a
good pipe to the internet all will be well and you should be able to
withstand a Slashdotting.

Most of the time when Slashdotting occurs, Slashdot has pointed to some
machine that is sitting in some kid's bedroom closet running on a Lego
Mindstorm robot powered by a potato.  Of course that 'server' will be
sizziling in no time. That is not scalable architecture.
