My good friend Rob (who started his own company, [Ocular Data
Solutions](http://oculardata.com/ "Complete tech solutions for ophthalmic practices"))
asked me for some good blogs to read since he is relatively new to
.NET.  I figured it would make a good post and give me a chance to send
some google juice his way. 

Without further ado, I give you my list of really nifty keen blogs that
should be in your opml:

-   [ComputerZen.com – Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/):
    With the very high level of signal versus noise in his blog, I doubt
    that Scott sleeps.
-   [Larkware News](http://www.larkware.com/): Mike Gunderloy puts
    together a great synopsis of what is going on in the tech/developer
    world.
-   [you’ve been HAACKED](http://haacked.com/Default.aspx): Phil Haack
    that is.  I’ve been reading his blog for awhile.  What I don’t
    understand is how the guy goes from not writing much, then he starts
    his own company and forks .TEXT into SubText and somehow he finds
    MORE time to blog.  Makes no sense, but I appreciate it.
-   [The Old New Thing](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/default.aspx):
    A MS blog written by Raymond Chen.  Not a .NET blog at all but
    should be in every .NET Developers blog roll.  He speaks in great
    depth about Win32 and various other APIs.  You did know that
    WinForms was built on Win32, right? :)
-   [Jason Haley](http://jasonhaley.com/blog/): Jason does daily
    “Interesting Finds” posts.  He reads more blogs in a day than I read
    in a month. (probably, my opml is only 168 feeds.  I’ve been
    pruning.  I think Jason is upwards of 700)

I’m probably missing a few dozen high quality ones, these are the ones
that I would highly recommend and if you told me I had to trim my list
to 5 blogs, this would be it.
