<DIV>I'm currently watching a little TV while I do a couple loads of laundry before I start my packing (it helps to have clothes to wear when going to a convention).&nbsp; Hopefully I'll be able to get a little sleep tonight then I'm off to Vegas for DevConnections.&nbsp; Again, if you are going to be there, shoot me an email and I'll send you my cell phone number.&nbsp; There is something like 15 restaurants in Mandalay Bay, so I'm sure we will be able to find somewhere to sit down for some food and drink.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Looking forward to an exciting event!</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Technorati Tags : <A href="http://technorati.com/tag/DevConnections" target=_blank rel=tag>DevConnections</A><!-- End Technorati Tags --></DIV>
