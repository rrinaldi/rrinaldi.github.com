<p>My good friend Rob (who started his own company, <a title="Complete tech solutions for ophthalmic practices" href="http://oculardata.com/" target="_blank">Ocular Data Solutions</a>) asked me for some good blogs to read since he is relatively new to .NET.&nbsp; I figured it would make a good post and give me a chance to send some google juice his way.&nbsp; </p> <p>Without further ado, I give you my list of really nifty keen blogs that should be in your opml:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">ComputerZen.com &ndash; Scott Hanselman</a>: With the very high level of signal versus noise in his blog, I doubt that Scott sleeps.</li> <li><a href="http://www.larkware.com/">Larkware News</a>: Mike Gunderloy puts together a great synopsis of what is going on in the tech/developer world.</li> <li><a href="http://haacked.com/Default.aspx">you&rsquo;ve been HAACKED</a>: Phil Haack that is.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been reading his blog for awhile.&nbsp; What I don&rsquo;t understand is how the guy goes from not writing much, then he starts his own company and forks .TEXT into SubText and somehow he finds MORE time to blog.&nbsp; Makes no sense, but I appreciate it.</li> <li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/default.aspx">The Old New Thing</a>: A MS blog written by Raymond Chen.&nbsp; Not a .NET blog at all but should be in every .NET Developers blog roll.&nbsp; He speaks in great depth about Win32 and various other APIs.&nbsp; You did know that WinForms was built on Win32, right? :)</li> <li><a href="http://jasonhaley.com/blog/">Jason Haley</a>: Jason does daily &ldquo;Interesting Finds&rdquo; posts.&nbsp; He reads more blogs in a day than I read in a month. (probably, my opml is only 168 feeds.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been pruning.&nbsp; I think Jason is upwards of 700)</li></ul> <p>I&rsquo;m probably missing a few dozen high quality ones, these are the ones that I would highly recommend and if you told me I had to trim my list to 5 blogs, this would be it.</p>
