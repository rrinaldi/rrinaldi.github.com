By the way, this post and the last one are/were written using a new
editor I found called [Qumana](http://www.qumana.com/).  It's free and
pretty good.  It doesn't seem to support the community server
categories, but it does have technorati tags which seem to make up for
it a little bit.  It has a slicker interface than any of the other tools
I've used (it has more of an Office feel, rather than Notepad).  It also
comes with some tools to insert ads into your posts, which in Scoble
speak is how they plan to "Monitize" their software.

If you are looking for an editor, check it out.  With spell check, a
thesaraus and multiple blog support it pretty slick. (I hope the fix the
category issue, because I'll probably still use BlogJet but Qumana is a
real close second.)
