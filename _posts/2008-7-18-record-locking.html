<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">On my most favoritest SQL Server mailing list, SSWUG, the question came up if it was possible for SQL Server to maintain a lock on an accessed record after a client disconnects from the server.  The question also asked that if it wasn't possible currently, would it be possible in next version of SQL Server (Yukon).  The quick answer is no, it's not currently possible.  Although I cannot speak for the availability of this “feature” in Yukon, I can't fathom why anybody would ever want it in the first place.  Most developers I know already know that having SQL server maintain a lock for a client (Pessimistic locking) is evil.  But since this developer was looking for this functionality, I figure that it's not as widely known as I thought (or hoped).  I figure I'll give a little bit of an explanation as to it's evils here, in the hopes that someone will stumble upon it.</font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">Pessimistic Locking requires the a database server (or application code in the database server) to make unavailable certain records of data when they have been "checked out" for editing by an application.  This application could be anything: a Windows application, a WebForm, a console app, a Web Service.  When the application is done with it's editing, it sends the data back to the server and the server unlocks the now updated records.  This would seem like a wonderful solution to concurrency issues, but it falls apart rather quickly.  What happens when the application never connects back to the server?  Now we have records locked in perpetuity.  Depending on the granularity of the lock, and how vital that record is to the system, you could now have a completely unresponsive application as it waits for a lock to be released.</font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">Your best bet is optimistic locking.  That is letting the data be checked out by multiple parties, but validate that the data has not changed since retrieval.  </font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">Meaning:</font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">1.) Get data</font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">2.) Manipulate data</font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">3.) Right before save, check to make sure data is the same as it was when data was retrieved.</font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">4.) Save data.</font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">This can easily be done by using a timestamp or GUID on the row that changes when any data is changed, or compare the data retrieved, column by column, to the data that is currently stored.</font></p> <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">Optimistic locking also allows an application to verify different data for different situations.  Maybe you don't want a parent record to be saved if the children have been updated?  With pessimistic locking, this would involve locking multiple records in multiple tables.  With optimistic locking, it just involves the retrieval of extra data and a quick check right before a save.</font></p>
