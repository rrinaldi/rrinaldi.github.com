<p>For the past couple days I&rsquo;ve been working on an integration project with <a href="http://www.bestsoftware.com/pfw/">Platinum for Windows</a>.&nbsp; Platinum uses a file based database engine called <a href="http://www.pervasive.com/">Pervasive</a>.&nbsp; Before this project I&rsquo;ve never really heard&nbsp;of it before, except in passing.&nbsp; Having never worked with a file based database before, I&rsquo;ve found a few things quite interesting:</p> <p>1.) Each table in the database corresponds directly to a file in a directory.&nbsp; In the documentation the terms table and file are used interchangeably which can sometimes get quite confusing.</p> <p>2.) Since each file is a table, the documentation explains exactly how the data is laid out in files.&nbsp; I believe the expectation is that you will be modifying files directly at some point.</p> <p>Pervasive apparently has a limitation on the number of letters in a file name, which leads to table/file names like &ldquo;ARLIN&rdquo; and &ldquo;ARTRAN&rdquo;.&nbsp; ARLIN is a &ldquo;Accounts Receivable Line Item&rdquo; and ARTRAN is &ldquo;Accounts Receivable Current Transaction&rdquo;.&nbsp; Sometimes an H is appended to the end of the file name.&nbsp; This could mean that it is a Historical table/file or if contains Header information for another table.</p> <p>Another problem is that Pervasive&rsquo;s SQL is quite limited.&nbsp; I was trying to do a few ad-hoc queries to get an idea of the data we have, and things like adding and subtracting numbers and converting between data types are completely foreign concepts to Pervasive.</p> <p>For the most part though, it looks to be an interesting project.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve already learned more about Accounting than I ever really planned on knowing. <img src="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan/images/smile1.gif" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
