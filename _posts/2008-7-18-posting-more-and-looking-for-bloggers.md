Up until this point the [Geekdojo](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan) has
been primarily focused on .NET and other Microsoft technologies.  From
now on though, the aggregated blog and it's feed will still remain
focused, but the individual bloggers will have freedom to post whatever
they feel like.  The new version of
[.Text](http://www.scottwater.com/dottext) allows a blogger to choose
whether or not a post is published to the aggregated site, so now there
is no guarantee that you will see every post by every author if you only
subscribe to the main feed.

When I first started blogging I figured that I would find it easy to
stay focused and only write about .NET, C\# and various other
techie/geeky topics.  But as I got more addicted to writing, I found
myself holding myself back from writing about other things.  So I plan
on using this new found freedom to explore other topics and areas of
interest.  If you care to follow my trip down the rabbit hole make sure
you subscribe to my personal feed
([http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan/rss.aspx](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan/rss.aspx)). 
Hope to see you in wonderland :)

On another note, we currently have 10 bloggers here.  I would love to
see 10 times that amount.  If there is anyone out there looking for a
place to blog, feel free to contact me.
