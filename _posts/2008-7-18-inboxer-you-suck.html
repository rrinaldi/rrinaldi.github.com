<P>Hey Inboxer-</P> <P>This is a direct letter to you.&nbsp; I don't mind if you want to advertise your product, but the comments on my blog is not a place for it.&nbsp; While I appreciate that you want free advertising and google juice, you could have just ASKED me to review your product.&nbsp; I would have been more than happy to post an honest and fair review of it.&nbsp; That should be acceptable to you because&nbsp;obviously you think that my blog is a great place to advertise your product, since you took it upon yourselves to use my site as an advertising medium.&nbsp; Not only mine, but Paul Steele's also (<A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/psteele/archive/2003/10/17/32381.aspx">http://weblogs.asp.net/psteele/archive/2003/10/17/32381.aspx</A>).</P> <P>I have removed your comment and until you decide to stop using comment spam as a means of advertising, I will do everything I can to make sure that my friends and family never use your product.</P> <P>Sincerely,</P> <P>-Ryan A. Rinaldi</P>
