<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>If it wasn't for you, Internet, not only would I be unemployed, I wouldn't be enjoying this wonderful Cubs game on TV.&nbsp; It's not that the Internet is required to watch the tube, but for me to be watching&nbsp;the game&nbsp;here in Chicago, having a play-by-play conversation with&nbsp;a friend in Texas on MSN,&nbsp;where he is watching it by streaming it through MLB.com is quite amazing.&nbsp; Using the Internet in my day to day life, I sometimes forget how magically it can be.</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Oh yeah, it's a no hitter through 6.&nbsp; That's cause my guy Clement is up there.&nbsp; Keep your fingers crossed. :)</FONT></P>
