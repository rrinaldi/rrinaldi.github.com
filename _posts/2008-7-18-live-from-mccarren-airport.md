Well, DevConnections is over.  Had a good time and met some good
people.  Juval Lowy's session on VS 2005 and C\# 2.0 was excellent.  He
reaffirmed a lot of my thoughts on C\# 2.0 and taught me quite a bit in
the process.  Coming from a non-CS background, sometimes it takes me
longer than I would like to understand very CS topics like generics and
anonymous methods.  (Polymorphism and inheritence also took some time. 
I had a very hard time wrapping my head around it initially and when I
did get it, it was a "a-ha" moment.)
 
My plane is now boarding so I'm off to my homeland of good ol' chicago! 
I stopped off earlier to fill up my tank of liquid courage so I will see
you all on the other side. 
 
Oh yeah, leaving Vegas up 300 and some dollars is a good feeling!
