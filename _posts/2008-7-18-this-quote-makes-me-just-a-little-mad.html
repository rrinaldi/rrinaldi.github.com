(That info is from the article, for all I know they sell poop on a stick (I've never heard of 'em))&nbsp; I'm curious as to what the "nerds" that work for that company think of their chief executive?</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">[UPDATE: Read iTKOs response to the article <a href="http://www.itko.com/site/itko?jpid=News&amp;news.id=9">here</a>]</font></p>
