More info tomorrow.  I hate it when people play these sorts of games
with me.  I think it all stems from my first "girlfriend" (I use the
term loosely, we were in 6th grade.  :)  That's when holding hands was
big time.)  One Monday she told me "I have a big surprise for you on
Friday."  Friday came, and I got dumped.

Damn women.
