I don't get it.  I've been developing with .NET now for a couple years
and for some strange reason I still work in a couple of projects with
ASP.  No, not the ASP.NET with all the object-oriented wonderness. 
ASP.  You know, that hideous old stepchild that we all keep locked away
in the basement?  Well, I'm trying to figure out why I elect to punish
myself.  There must be some drug that is causing me to do this.  I think
the thought process goes something like this:

Ryan: “This is a small app.  Nobody is ever going to use it, really.  I
can whip this up in a minute with ASP.  ASP wasn't that bad.  I mean,
come on, you've written hundreds of these things in your sleep.  This
won't take more than 15 minutes.”

9 days later I come out.  I must have been a fool.  How did I know that
this app was going to interface with 15 different systems and require
BizTalk integration with a DB2 database???

Anyway, I just came out of another one of those projects.  and I hope
and pray that I finally learned a lesson.
