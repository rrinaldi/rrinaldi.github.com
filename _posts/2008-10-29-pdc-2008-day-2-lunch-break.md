Taking a quick break to install Vista SP1.  I'm prepping my machine to
install Win7 and VS2010 because I'm apparently certifiably insane (so
says Ray and Richard).

 

The Parallel Framework stuff I saw in the last session is incredibly
sweet.  The lightweight Tasks are pure genius and Parallel LINQ is so
silly easy I would find it hard to not use.  While that is easy to say
now since I have yet to actually play with it, but from the demo there
are very little new concepts that you have to learn and the framework
allows scaling to *n*number of cores simple.

 

After my little lunch break here I'm heading over to "Oslo" :
Customizing and Extending the Visual Design Experience.
