How do you do status reviews?

At the office we currently have:

1.) Weekly status reports - These are 1 or 2 line synopsis's of what we
are currently doing, estimated completion date, any extraneous info that
needs to be bubbled up the management chain

2.) Monthly self reflection reviews - On these we score ourselves on a
scale of 1 - 100 on how we did that month and list our top 5
accomplishments or results. 

3.) Quarterly reviews - For people on the bonus structure this is when
they would receive a bonus and the manager sits down with him or her and
goes over the last quarter and highlights the good and the bad that
occurred.

Now there is being proposed another monthly status report (an MBO if
your familiar with the term) which lists your monthly objectives and how
important those are (out of a 100%).

I'm much more comfortable with objective based status and performance
reviews.  I find it motivates me more, gives me a better sense of
direction and allows me to budget time more effectively.  But what about
the rest of you? (All 3 or so of my readers). How does your workplace do
reviews?  Is it common to have so many different types?
