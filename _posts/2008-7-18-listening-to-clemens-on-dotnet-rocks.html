<P>So I'm currently listening to <A href="http://www.franklins.net/dotnetrocks/">DotNet Rocks!</A> on my new Nomad Zen Xtra Jukebox (more on my new toy later)&nbsp;and I have a couple things I need to point out:</P><P>1.) <A href="http://www.neopoleon.com/blog/">Rory</A> made a reference to wxWindows.&nbsp; FYI, wxWindows changed it's name to wxWidgets a couple months ago.&nbsp; Apparently the mother ship (Microsoft)&nbsp;has taken issue with the toolkits name.&nbsp; You can find more on&nbsp;the name change&nbsp;<A href="http://www.wxwindows.org/name.htm">here</A>.&nbsp; </P><P>2.) A little confession: this was my first time listening to dotNet Rocks and now I'm hooked.&nbsp; How could I live without this in my life?&nbsp; DotNet Rocks, you complete me.</P><P>3.) I just finsihed listening to it and I recommend that anybody that is interested in SOA needs to listen to the episode with Clemens.&nbsp; Go download it now.&nbsp; I'll still be here after you do.&nbsp;&nbsp;SOA makes so much sense now it's un-freakin-believable.</P><P>4.) Clemens made the comment that there are not enough Software Architects out there. I whole-heartily agree with him.&nbsp; I hope to be one someday (I still have a lot of industry dues to pay first.)</P>
