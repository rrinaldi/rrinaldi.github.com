<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>After DevDays (which I wasn't lucky enough to attend) a <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/mhawley/archive/2004/03/11/87955.aspx">gaggle of geeks</A>&nbsp;(which I was lucky enough to attend)&nbsp;got together for some talking, eating, drinking and general merrymaking.&nbsp; The sad part was that out of the 6 people that showed up, only 2 were from Chicago proper (<A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jkey">Jeff Key</A> and I).&nbsp; Jeff and I got to talking and came to the conclusion that Chicago needs to represent.&nbsp; So I'm looking for people that would be interested in doing a semi-regular geek dinner/get together/party/event thing.&nbsp; We could do these on a Saturday so we could get some people to come into the city from the greater Chicagoland area.&nbsp; And I don't know about you, but my work schedule makes it practically impossible to do anything on a weeknight.</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>This is completely non-committal at this point in time. I'm just floating an idea out to see if there would be interest.</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>If this takes off, maybe we could even formalize it into a user group of sorts. (Before the Chicago .NET user group gets mad at me: It's not that I don't like you, it's that you have meetings on weeknights at 6 o'clock 30 miles outside the city which makes it practically impossible for me or most city dwellers to get out there especially since most of the guys I know don't have cars.)</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>So are there any takers?&nbsp; Either drop me a line in the comments section, or use the spiffy "Contact" link at the top left of the page.</FONT></P>
