There have been a
[couple](http://weblogs.asp.net/ssmith/posts/32378.aspx)
[people](http://weblogs.asp.net/psteele/posts/32381.aspx) that have
mentioned [SpamBayes](http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/) lately.  In
short, it rocks.  Best-Spam-Mail-Filter-Ever.  One of the interesting
side effects of ALL the spam filtering software I have tried is that
they all seem to think that email from my boss
([Ray](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/jez)) is spam.  I have worked for Ray
at 2 different places, with 2 different email setups, with 2
different spam filtering applications. I don't know if its his writing
style, or maybe his name, but I ALWAYS have to train software not to
delete his email.

I think Spam filtering software wants me to get fired.
