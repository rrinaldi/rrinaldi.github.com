<P>I just noticed that in Community Server 1.1 the “Community Participation” setting on blog posts default to “Yes”.&nbsp; If you don’t wish for your post to be displayed on the main site (if the post is off-topic, personal, etc.), please make sure to change this setting.</P> <P>As an aside, it would be really nice if there was a change log that was publicly available instead of hunting for changes from one version to the other.&nbsp; </P>
