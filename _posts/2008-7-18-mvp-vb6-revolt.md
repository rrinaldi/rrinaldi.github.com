Okay so Scoble calls it a
[revolt](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/03/08.html#a9568), but I
would consider it more of a disagreement.  So does [Dan
Appleman](http://www.danappleman.com/index.php?p=35).

My take?  Goodbye doesn't always mean goodbye.  Should VB6 continue to
be fully supported?  Nope.  Should all VB6 developers port all the code
to .NET on April 1st?  Heck no.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but uh VB6 makes COM .dlls.  .NET can talk to
COM.  COM can talk to .NET.  So maybe the VB6 developers can start
writing new code in .NET?  [SARCASM]You know, I should really tell
everybody about this, because I'm sure they haven't though of it before
now. [/SARCASM]

In all honesty, I don't have anything more to add to the story.  I think
it is silly, and if you didn't see this coming you're blind.  Doesn't
matter, because MS will probably extend support anyway.

[**UPDATE**: TheServerSide.NET has a [poll
up](http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=32457) on
whether MS should continue supporting VB6.]
