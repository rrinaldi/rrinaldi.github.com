<P>Maybe it hit me later than most, but I finally believe that blogging is more than just a fad.&nbsp; Maybe it is the rumor that BillG will be blogging or the fact that the <A href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan/">COO of Sun is blogging</A>.&nbsp; Blogging has created the Utopia of self publishing that the Internet was proclaimed to be.&nbsp; Seriously, reading this is proof.&nbsp; Would any newspaper or magazine publish my ramblings?&nbsp; Hell no.&nbsp; But people read it anyway.&nbsp; Maybe Google will get you here, or maybe you're one of my few friends that actually read this drivel. :)&nbsp; Anyway, I find it quite liberating that I'm able to freely publish my thoughts as easily as the COO of Sun does and if my thoughts are the least bit interesting people will read it.</P>
