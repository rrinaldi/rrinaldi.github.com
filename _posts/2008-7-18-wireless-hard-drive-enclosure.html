<p>I&rsquo;m a guy without a desktop.&nbsp; At home I only use laptops, which is great and all but it comes with a couple downsides.&nbsp; One of those downsides is that the collection of old hard drives that I have has been almost completely useless.&nbsp; I know I could use a external enclosure but that is pretty pointless when I have my laptops so I can roam around my apartment unencumbered by cords and accessories.&nbsp; For people like me, DLink has come out with an <a href="http://www.dlink.com/products/?sec=0&amp;pid=377">external hard drive enclosure that runs over a wireless network!</a>&nbsp; This is great!&nbsp; Not only can it be used as an enclosure but it also allows you to add up to two USB 2.0/1.1 drives for more storage and can be used as a wireless access point.&nbsp; This is going on my list of things to buy.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
