So now I have VOIP in my apartment through
[Vonage](http://www.vonage.com).  So far so good.  The quality is on par
with that of a very good cell connection and for the price I'm paying
for service I feel like I'm getting a steal.  Free  long distance
anywhere in the US and Canada, Caller ID, Call Waiting, Voice-mail (that
I can listen to over the web!), and call transferring.  The web
interface is great, allowing me to administer my account and even view
all of the calls to and from my number.  The setup was a breeze.  All I
needed to do was hookup the Cisco VOIP device to my network, plug it in
to the wall, plug in the phone and I was off.  If you have broadband I
suggest you take a look into this.
