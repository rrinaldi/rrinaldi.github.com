I got this link from [Jeff
Key](http://weblogs.asp.net/jkey/posts/39304.aspx) (*I'm placing it here
so I might be able to find it again*):  Microsoft's [SQL Server Best
Practices Analyzer](http://weblogs.asp.net/jkey/posts/39304.aspx).  I've
been playing with it for a little while now and it seems to be rather
interesting.  It could use some more instructions, or they need to
rethink the user interface.   I found it rather hard to figure out what
exactly I was supposed to be doing.

On a similar note, I'm quite happy that Microsoft is continuing to push
Best Practices on us.  Some developers don't need them, but the ones
that do REALLY do.
