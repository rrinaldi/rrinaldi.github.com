Hey Inboxer-

This is a direct letter to you.  I don't mind if you want to advertise
your product, but the comments on my blog is not a place for it.  While
I appreciate that you want free advertising and google juice, you could
have just ASKED me to review your product.  I would have been more than
happy to post an honest and fair review of it.  That should be
acceptable to you because obviously you think that my blog is a great
place to advertise your product, since you took it upon yourselves to
use my site as an advertising medium.  Not only mine, but Paul Steele's
also

I have removed your comment and until you decide to stop using comment
spam as a means of advertising, I will do everything I can to make sure
that my friends and family never use your product.

Sincerely,

-Ryan A. Rinaldi
