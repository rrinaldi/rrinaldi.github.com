I'm going out to DevConnections in Vegas next week (along with
[Richard](/richard)and [Ray](/jez)).  Anybody want to get together some
evening for a few drinks and some geeking out?  I'm sure there will be
plenty to talk about.  Drop me an email at
[ryan@ryanrinaldi.com](mailto:ryan@ryanrinaldi.com).

See you there!
