Sorry that the site has been serving up an error page for the last 12
hours or so when clicking on a post to view the comments.  I just got
home and decided to investigate the error and after setting the custom
error setting in the web.config file to “Off”, the error magically went
away.  Poof!  Gone.  Banished to the land of wind and ghosts. After
putting the setting back to “RemoteOnly” everything still works.  I
guess the app needed to be restarted.  Maybe it was just tired.  Or
worse yet, it became self aware (I believe Scott wrote a provider for
that...) and figured out it was a blogging engine, spewing half formed
thoughts into the ether and tried to kill itself.  Either way, I hope it
doesn't happen again.
