Slow day in blogging world.  At least I have a new project at work to
keep me busy. :)  (and a couple new tech toys.  More on them later.)

* * * * *

[Virtual Server 2005 R2 now costs zero
dollars](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/virtualserver/software/default.mspx):
Amazing what you will do when your competitors offer a superior product
for free.  Wonder when prices for Office will be slashed? *[via

[DataWindow.NET](http://www.sybase.com/products/developmentintegration/datawindownet)
is now available from Sybase: This will make my brother the
Java/Powerbuilder nut quite happy.  When he was on a .NET project all I
kept hearing was “DataWindow this, DataWindow that, DataWindow makes
ADO.NET and Dataset look like sh\*t.” *[via The Daily
Grind](http://www.larkware.com/dg5/TheDailyGrind853.html)*

[Inbox Zero](http://www.43folders.com/izero/): 43Folders has been
running a series on how to experience the lovely zen that is an empty
inbox.
