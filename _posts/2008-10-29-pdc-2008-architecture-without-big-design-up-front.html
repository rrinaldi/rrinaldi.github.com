<p>(I lied. I didn't make it to the Oslo session.&nbsp; I went to the "Big Room" and spent tons of time getting swag and talking to vendors.&nbsp; I also spent lots of time with <a href="http://blog.dotnetwiki.org/">Peli</a> talking and learning about <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/Pex/">Pex</a>.&nbsp; <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/Pex/">Pex</a> looks to be a very compelling whitebox testing platform.&nbsp; I suggest you take a look into it.)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So now I'm in the Peter Provost talk.&nbsp; I read his blog but I've never seen any of his presentations so I'm really looking forward to this one.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>Good Architecture is about communicating design.</li> <li>All systems have an architecture whether you plan it or not.</li></ul> <p>The crowd seems to be mostly "Agile" (we figured that out by the standard "Round of Applause" methodology.&nbsp; I think they are lying or don't know what "Agile" really is.&nbsp; Just an opinion.)</p> <ul> <li>Most Architectures are "Big Ball of Mud"</li> <li>Architecture is about ending system that is better than with what you started with.</li> <li>Architectural Discovery</li> <ul> <li>Everyone has existing code bases</li> <li>Key architectural elements are undocumented</li> <li>Maintenance is hard</li> <li>Changes expensive</li></ul> <li>We are going to use the CTP bits of Architecture Explorer on Rawr (Check on CodePlex for it)</li> <ul> <li>Cool project dependency diagram</li> <li>Project dependency graphs have multiple views</li> <li>Can create class dependencies also</li> <li>Sometimes it's good to look at the pictures that are generated in the diagrams instead of trying to look for patterns that will show you key types in the solution/project</li> <li>Drilling into what looks to be key types you can find code and method level relationships</li> <li>Architecture Explorer supports Sequence Diagrams, Very cool.
