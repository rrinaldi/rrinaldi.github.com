I would like to extend a warm welcome to two more bloggers that have
decided to join us over here at the Dojo.  [Paul
Bartlett](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/pdbartlett) and [Matt
Eubank](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/matt).  I'm sure both of them are
eager to begin blogging and sharing their wealth of knowledge with the
world.

Again, if anybody is interested in having a blog here at the GeekDojo I
would be more than happy to set you up with one.  Feel free to contact
me ([email@ryanrinaldi.com](mailto:email@ryanrinaldi.com))
