**When:** Wednesday, February 29th, 2006\
**Where:** Rock Bottom @ State & Grand\
**Where:** 6PM

After a long discussion with
[Jeff](http://weblogs.asp.net/jkey "Jeff Key"), we decided that we still
needed to have a February geek meet even though there is not much time
left in the month.  To give people ample notice, we have extended
February by one day.  If you have not received your updated February
2006 Jeff/Ryan calendar by the time you read this, please be aware that
February 29th will fall on March 1st.

Look forward to seeing you all there!
