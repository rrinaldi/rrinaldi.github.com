In a press release today, [MySQL AB](http://www.mysql.com/) [announced
that MySQL now supports Stored
Procedures](http://www.mysql.com/press/release_2004_02.html).

\*Cough\*

WHAT?

It seems that MySQL will finally support Stored Procedures.  Also added
in is server side cursor support, enhanced portability and migration.

This is all well and good, but I feel bad for people that use MySQL. 
While they are all geared up for stored procedures, I'm looking forward
to using C\# and the CLR inside my database engine of choice.  Stored
procedures are SO pre-.NET man.
