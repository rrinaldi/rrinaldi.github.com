A coworker of mine brought this to my attention and he demanded that I
blog about it. :)

If you open up Query Analyzer and bring up the Find dialog, you will
notice something very odd about it.  It's MODAL!  How many times you do
actually run find once, have it find what your looking for and then
close it?  I normally leave it open so I can futz with the code and then
run Find again to find the next occurrence. 

Just another one of those things that make me go grr.....
