Eight.  Wow.  Another one joins the Geekdojo.  (Actually he joined
yesterday, but who's counting?)

I'd like to welcome [Adam Field](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/adam/) to
site.  I'm sure he will be bringing vast amounts of knowledge to share. 
(And being a technical writer I'm hoping he can help me improve my
grammar :)

If anybody out there reading this is interested in a blog, feel free to
drop me an email and I'd be happy to hook you up.  That's why I started
this site.  I'm hoping that people will come out of the wordwork and
share the knowledge that they have gained over the years.  You don't
have to be a good writer to blog (just look at me), you just have to
have something to say.  And from what I can tell, most geeks think that
they have something to say!
