<p>I was telling a coworker the other day how awesome it is to fire up the internet on my way into work on the train.&#160; Since he also takes the train and has a longer commute then me I suggested he give it a try.&#160; First question that came up was “Is it really fast enough to get work done?” </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><a href="http://ryanrinaldi.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/MobilebroadbandFTW_7B79/image_2.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://ryanrinaldi.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/MobilebroadbandFTW_7B79/image_thumb.png" width="244" height="134" /></a> </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>It’s not cable modem speeds but it sure is fast enough for most things!&#160; I’m able to pull down code from svn repositories, I’ve done svn commits, twittered, googled all without a hitch. I’m loving it.</p>
