2 different templates for MV2

-   MVC 2 Web Application
-   MVC 2 Empty Web Application

 

(BTW, this is code heavy demo so there might not be a lot of notes.)

I’m going to point out that Jon couldn’t get his first demo to compile.
:P 

We are building a store

-   Home page
-   Store
    -   List page
    -   Details page

Routes map between URLs and Controller Actions.

Controller actions and views are mapped by convention.

New HtmlHelper in MVC2 – EditorFor and EditorForModel (Interesting
stuff!)

Support for Display and Editor templates

(Templating stuff looks very interesting.  Need to find a real project
to try this stuff out on.)
