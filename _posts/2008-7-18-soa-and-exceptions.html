<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So <a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ray">Ray</a> and I were discussing SOA at the office today and trying to figure out how to handle exceptions gracefully.&nbsp; When you get an exception from a webservice all you get is a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemWebServicesProtocolsSoapExceptionClassTopic.asp">SoapException</a>.&nbsp; That doesn't tell you much.&nbsp; Take this example:</font></p> <ol> <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Add new user to application</font></li> <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Application calls AddUser service</font></li> <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">AddUser service attempts to add the user to the database</font></li> <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Database throws a primary key violation</font></li> <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">AddUser throws a DuplicateUserException internally</font></li> <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">The webservice returns a SoapException that contains the text of the DuplicateUserException.</font></li></ol> <div><font face="Verdana" size="2">At this point I have a SoapException that I can't do anything with.&nbsp; I have no clue why it was thrown. The DuplicateUserException is completely lost. [Well, almost lost.&nbsp; It's in the Message property of the SoapException.&nbsp; Should I have to parse the string to find it? That seems so totally wrong.]&nbsp; What if I want to tell the user something other than "It no worky, try again.&nbsp; Maybe it worky now."</font></div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div><font face="Verdana" size="2">We worked around this problem by returning status codes, but that is SO HRESULT-ish that it makes my skin crawl.&nbsp; There has to be a better way to make this work.&nbsp; Did we miss something?&nbsp; Is there something obvious that I am overlooking? Can some of you SOA guys shed some light on this for me?</font></div>
