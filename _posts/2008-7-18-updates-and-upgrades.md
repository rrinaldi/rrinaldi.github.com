This is just a note to inform you that the dojo will be under going some
minor maintenance in approx. 24 hours.  If things go wonky, don't act
like you weren't warned. :)

When the site comes back, it will have been upgraded to
[.Text](http://www.scottwater.com/dottext) .95 goodness.  I'm really
looking forward to this upgrade. 

Now I'm off to yell at the backup monkey to make sure that we get an
extra backup in the rotation.
