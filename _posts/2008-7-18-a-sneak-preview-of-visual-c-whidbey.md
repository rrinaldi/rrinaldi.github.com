I took a look at the "[Sneak Preview of Visual C\#
Whidbey](http://http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dv_vstechart/html/whidbey_csharp_preview.asp)".

Some of the things I'm looking forward to the most?

Easy: The debugging enhancements! 

Be sure to check out the Enhanced Datatips, Visualizers, and the Design
Time Expression Evaluation (yeah, I said Design time!  This is going to
be sweet....)
