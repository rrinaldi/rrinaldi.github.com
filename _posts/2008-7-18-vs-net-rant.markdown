Why does VS.NET allow me to start debugging something when none of my
code is compiled in Debug mode? Huh?  I can't debug.  It knows I can't
since it compiled the darn code for me.  It knows I have no debugging
symbols anywhere.

Also, why does Visual Studio randomly lose my preferences?  The other
day I rebooted and all of my toolbars decided to move back to their
defaults. :(

It's a big practical joke I tell ya.  VS.NET is handing me the bottle of
peanut brittle and I'm opening up a jar of snakes.

Go ahead and laugh Visual Studio, go ahead.  You'll get yours.
