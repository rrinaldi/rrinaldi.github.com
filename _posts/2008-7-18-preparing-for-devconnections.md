I'm currently watching a little TV while I do a couple loads of laundry
before I start my packing (it helps to have clothes to wear when going
to a convention).  Hopefully I'll be able to get a little sleep tonight
then I'm off to Vegas for DevConnections.  Again, if you are going to be
there, shoot me an email and I'll send you my cell phone number.  There
is something like 15 restaurants in Mandalay Bay, so I'm sure we will be
able to find somewhere to sit down for some food and drink.
 
Looking forward to an exciting event!
