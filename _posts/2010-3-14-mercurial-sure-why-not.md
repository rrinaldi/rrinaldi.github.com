Some of the new super cool things on the block are Distributed Version
Control Systems and being somebody that is into super cool new things I
figured I would spend some time and get to know them.

A couple months ago [Steve](http://stevenkuhn.net) and I had a
hack-a-thon weekend and he introduced me to [Git](http://git-scm.com/).
I have to say that I didn’t really like Git.  I found it a bit
cumbersome and confusing.  Honestly, that is probably more my fault than
Git’s because I had no idea how DVCSs worked and Git is a little to
powerful to be put in the hands of a novice.  Needless to say handing me
Git was like handing me a .45 and pointing it at my foot.  It was only a
matter of time until I shot myself.

So after blowing off both of my feet and a few other appendages I wrote
DVCS off as a bad idea.  Luckily [Joel
Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) wrote a very awesome [intro to
Mercurial](http://hginit.com/) that peeked my interest again.  Reading
the intro filled in a lot of the blanks in my mental model of how DVCS
works.  I suggest you spend some time reading the intro and then do as I
did and go purchase the really awesome [Mastering
Mercurial](http://tekpub.com/preview/hg) series from TekPub.  Once you
watch that I think you’ll find Mercurial (and Git) a very compelling SCM
solution.  I found it compelling enough to get a
[Kiln](http://kilnhg.com) account and try it out on a real honest to
goodness (private) project.
