<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>CruiseControl.NET is my new shiny toy that I've been playing with, and I'm having a lot of fun.&nbsp; I have a couple ideas for some different publisher blocks that I would like to create, but I'm not sure the best approach.&nbsp; I can't seem to find any documentation on the XML serialization that is being used internally to CruiseControl.NET to parse the config files and I'm not sure if I can create a publisher block in external assemblies or if I need to add my blocks to the source code.&nbsp; If anybody has any experience writing custom blocks, I would be very interested in hearing from you.</FONT></P>
