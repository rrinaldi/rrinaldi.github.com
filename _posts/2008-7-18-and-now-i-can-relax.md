Well, now that the I completely botched the .Text upgrade on the server
and spent all of my free time for the last 2 days replacing content that
should have been backed up, I can finally sit back with a glass of wine,
some John Mayer and relax.  Yeah I know it sounds fruity, but everybody
needs to unwind somehow.  I don't know what exactly I did wrong when
upgrading but I lost everything on the site.  Not a big deal if you
backup your databases, but NO I'm a moron and the backups weren't
working.  So thanks to a good friend of mine, [Google
Cache](http://www.google.com), I was able to manually recreate about 90%
of the content on the site.  The only things that got zapped were a
single comment in [Ray's blog](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/jez) and the
last 4 posts that I made.  Wouldn't be a big problem if Ray wasn't so
attached to that single comment :) I'm now off to double check all my
updates and maybe get some sleep.

In closing I give you these truths:

1.  Wine: Good!
2.  John Mayer: Good!
3.  Google Cache: Good!
4.  Not backing up databases: BAD!
