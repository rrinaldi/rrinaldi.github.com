<p>The other day, I posted about my ideal concept of <a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan/archive/2005/05/17/8343.aspx">source control for database schema</a>&nbsp;and I got a few interesting comments.&nbsp; </p> <p>A lot of people recommended Red Gate Software&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/SQL_Compare.htm">SQL Compare</a> tool.&nbsp; I have been a customer of Red Gate for awhile and I&rsquo;m quite happy with SQL Compare.&nbsp; It comes quite close to being the perfect tool for merging database schema and objects.&nbsp; Where it falls a little short is when updating stored procedures and views.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t actually merge the procedures and views.&nbsp; You have the choice of migrating your version of the object or not.&nbsp; What I would like to see is something that can merge objects as easily as you can merge source code.&nbsp; Also, as the name of tool states, it&rsquo;s a comparing tool not a <em>control </em>tool.&nbsp; I would love to see an application that gives me all of the features of a quality source control management application. </p> <p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/fbouma">Frans Bouma</a> said that I was running into problems because I didn&rsquo;t do proper design.&nbsp; I can concede that the database for our internal apps does not have the greatest design in the world, but I fail to see how that has anything to do with differencing and merging schema.&nbsp; Even if I go and design the worlds greatest database I think I would still benefit from a quality schema merging tool.&nbsp; (As an aside, he mentioned the use of stored procedures versus dynamic sql.&nbsp; Frans and I share a similar view on stored procs but that is another conversation.)</p> <p>I can think of a couple reasons why it&rsquo;s a good idea, but I haven&rsquo;t come up with any that make it a downright bad idea.&nbsp; But there are smart people out there that can tell me why. <img src="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan/images/smile1.gif" /></p>
