[Scott](http://scottwater.com/blog/posts/10422.aspx) mentions that
[Don](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/) told him that
[Indigo](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/understanding/pillars/Indigo/default.aspx)
will be available for non-Longhorn versions of Windows sometime after
the release of [Whidbey](http://www.asp.net/whidbey/).  Now, this is
cool.  I haven't had a chance to play with Indigo yet, but I'm dying for
the opportunity.  If/When I play with it I'm going to want to implement
something and if/when I implement something I want it to be able to run
on as many machines as possible.  I was quite concerned that only
Longhorn would support all these wonderful new toys. (Which I understand
is the point of Longhorn.  Show us something shiny in the hopes that we
will want it.  Well we want it, and we want our old toys too, dang it!)
