<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>So I've been using this <A href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan/archive/2004/06/30/2356.aspx">MCE theme</A> for the past day, and I have to say I really love it.&nbsp; My only problem is that it's the only "official" theme I've seen come from Microsoft and I'm using the term official quite loosely since the theme was never intended to be used on anything but MCE.&nbsp; MS went through all this trouble to write a theme engine for XP and then they never release any themes?&nbsp; What's up with that?&nbsp; I've been told that there are some in the XP Plus pack but there aren't enough to justify buying it.&nbsp; So why won't MS release more?&nbsp; Are they worried about putting some small&nbsp;ISV out of business?</FONT></P>
