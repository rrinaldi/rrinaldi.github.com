At work I have 2 monitors and my trusty laptop <a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan/archive/2005/03/24/7538.aspx">MojoDojo</a>&nbsp;playing the part of&nbsp;the 3rd monitor.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="http://www.maxivista.com/">MaxiVista</a>&nbsp;to pull of this feat for quite awhile now.&nbsp; The cool thing is that the mother of all extendo-monitor apps is <a href="http://www.maxivista.com/new.htm">now at version 2</a>.&nbsp; Adding a wonderful, splendiforous feature: Remote Control.&nbsp; Now with the flick of the Scroll Lock key (configurable if you happen to be using scroll lock for something else), I can remote control my laptop and then with a flick back it becomes a 3rd monitor.&nbsp; I love it!&nbsp; When I need to drag something over there and I&rsquo;m craving a little more screen real estate, I make my laptop a monitor.&nbsp; Otherwise, I have it churning and burning away as a Command and Control center for all of my communications apps (Outlook, MSN, Trillian (Yes, I run MSN and Trillian.&nbsp; Trillian for my buddies and MSN for work, so I can have all the wonderful app sharing, white-boarding goodness)).&nbsp; When&nbsp;an email pops up, I just move my cursor off of my one machine and right onto my other.&nbsp;My work box need not spin it&rsquo;s cycles checking exchange any longer! Oh, did I mention that it can remote control up to 3 other PCs, and it syncs the clipboard?&nbsp; Yeah, MaxiVista rocks that much harder than it used to.
