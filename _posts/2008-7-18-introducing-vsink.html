<P>I saw <A href="http://journals.tuxreports.com/lch/archives/002765.html">this post</A> by the Incremental Blogger explaining some ideas for integrating ink with Visual Studio.&nbsp; After reading the post, I thought “Gotta have it!&nbsp; Must have it!&nbsp; Where’s the install?”.&nbsp; After realizing that his post was just a teaser and he hadn’t released anything, I figured I would write it myself.&nbsp; I decided to write it as a CodeRush plugin, since the CodeRush API is SO much sweeter than the VS Add-In API.&nbsp; Here is a screen shot:</P> <P align=center><IMG alt="vsInk screenshot" src="/photos/ryan/images/8910/original.aspx" border=0></P> <P align=left>Right now it has the following features:</P> <UL> <LI> <DIV align=left>Multiple colored ink</DIV> <LI> <DIV align=left>Select and Resize ink strokes</DIV> <LI> <DIV align=left>Saving and loading of ink.</DIV> <LI> <DIV align=left>3 different pen sizes</DIV> <LI> <DIV align=left>Erasing ink</DIV></LI></UL> <P align=left>Since I don’t have a tablet, I haven’t been able to actually test it with a Tablet PC, so I’m looking for somebody to try it out and let me know how it goes.</P> <P>Oh and to answer a question I got a lot when showing it to friends: Yes, the ink scrolls relative to the code.&nbsp; You scroll down, it goes up, you scroll up, it goes down. It’s actually quite cool.&nbsp; If there is a lot of interest, I’ll probably tidy it up and release the code.</P> <P>I’m going to spend a little bit of time this week and finish testing it.&nbsp; I’ll probably release it later this week or early next week.&nbsp; When I do, please keep in mind that this is more of a “Concept Application” and less “Enterprise quality, mission critical application”.&nbsp; So don’t blame me if it kicks your dog.&nbsp; I tried to warn you.</P>
