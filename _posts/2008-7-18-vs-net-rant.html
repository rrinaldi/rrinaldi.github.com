<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Why does VS.NET allow me to start debugging something when none of my code is compiled in Debug mode? Huh?  I can't debug.  It knows I can't since it compiled the darn code for me.  It knows I have no debugging symbols anywhere.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Also, why does Visual Studio randomly lose my preferences?  The other day I rebooted and all of my toolbars decided to move back to their defaults. :(</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's a big practical joke I tell ya.  VS.NET is handing me the bottle of peanut brittle and I'm opening up a jar of snakes.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Go ahead and laugh Visual Studio, go ahead.  You'll get yours.</font></p>
