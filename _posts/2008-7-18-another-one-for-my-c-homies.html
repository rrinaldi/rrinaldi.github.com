In there you'll meet Jonathan Caves. He's a compiler developer on the VC++ team and he likes coffee. Starbucks coffee.<br /> <br /> Most of our applications, and Windows itself,&nbsp;are compiled with the VC++ team's amazing compiler. We talked a bit about the trends in the industry and how compilers are changing to react.<br /> <br /> In the hall we meet Chuck Mitchell, a senior architect on the VC++ team. He kindly stops to chat with us about Phoenix which is a development framework for the next generation of compilers.<br /></p></blockquote>
