<P>I've upgraded the Dojo to the Community Server!</P> <P>3 hours of conversion, 1 hour of setup, and a randomly failing router (hardware always picks the best times to die) later all is well. (Well, not really.&nbsp; I expect problems.)</P> <P>If there are any problems, please let me know and I will see to them as soon as I possibly can.</P> <P>Anyway, I hope that everybody here at the dojo is happy with the upgrade, and I hope the migration to newer versions of CS will be a lot smoother.</P>
