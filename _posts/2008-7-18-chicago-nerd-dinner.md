Come on out for drinks, merriment, code talk, drinks, PDC reviews,
drinks, meeting a new Developer Evangelist, drinks and maybe a beer.

Summer is over, Microsoft just re-org'ed and C\# 3.0 and VB 9.0 were
unveiled (in super alpha form), so come on out and tell us what you
think.Â 

And this time I promise to leave the monkeys at home. (Unless they agree
to pay their way.)
