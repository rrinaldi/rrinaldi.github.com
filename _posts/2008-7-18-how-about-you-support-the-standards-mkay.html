<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I've been working on some vCard/vCalendar export code at work for the past couple of days, the main purpose being to import the resulting vCard/vCalendar files into Outlook.&nbsp; The problem being that Outlook doesn't have any decent support for the vCalendar spec.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">First gripe: The vCalendar spec outlines 2 types of "calendar entities": vEvent and vTodo.&nbsp; vEvent support is so-so and Outlook doesn't support vTodo at all.&nbsp; :(</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Gripe the 2nd: A vCalendar file is pretty much an envelope around vEvents.&nbsp; This would allow you to create multiple vEvents and vTodos and wrap them up in a single file for import.&nbsp; If Outlook is presented with a vCalendar file that contains multiple vEvents it grabs the first one and ignores the rest.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Gripe C: Parameter support. Frankly it kind of stinks.</font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">The following vCalendar parameters are things that:</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">a.) Are supported, but the results are different from what is outlined in the spec.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">OR</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">b.) Are not supported, the spec does not require that it be supported but Outlook has functionality that could support it.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Group A:</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">PRIORITY:</font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">The&nbsp;parameter is defined as 1&nbsp;being highest priority, 2 being second highest priority and so on with 0 (zero) being undefined.&nbsp; Outlook decided that greater than&nbsp;0 is High priority, 0 is Normal priority, and&nbsp;less than 0&nbsp;is Low priority.&nbsp; The spec doesn't even outline negative numbers, since you're not supposed to use them!&nbsp; According to the spec, the lower the number the higher the priority.&nbsp; According to Outlook, the lower the number the lower the priority.&nbsp; Complete opposite.</font></p> <p><font><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">CLASS: This parameter supports the following properties: PUBLIC, PRIVATE, CONFIDENTIAL.&nbsp; The strange thing is when you set it CONFIDENTIAL, Outlook changes the sensitivity of the event, but doesn't mark it as private.&nbsp; Maybe I'm alone on this one, but if something is confidential it sure as hell is private!</font></font></font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Group B:</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">DALARM:&nbsp;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">This parameter lets you specify when you should be alerted about a calendar event.&nbsp; Outlook ignores this one entirely, but the spec does say that adherence is optional.&nbsp; Since Outlook does have an option to remind the user about an event, I figured that they would have some rudimentary support for this.</font></p> <p><font><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">TRANSP: Supposedly, setting this to 0 means that the event will show time as "Free".&nbsp; Outlook ignores this one.&nbsp; The spec even goes as far to let the application interpret the number however it wants (unlike the PRIORITY field, which Outlook freely redefines).</font></font></font></p> <p><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></font></font></p>
