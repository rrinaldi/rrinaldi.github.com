According to a very smart man ([Haacked](http://www.haacked.com/)), [his
PageRank numbers seem to be
dropping](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/08/24/9646.aspx) and he
attributes it to rel=”nofollow”.  Now I don’t know if that is true, but
this blog post is to accomplish 2 things:

1.) Link to his site, to help increase his page rank.

2.) Give me something to blog about.
