Okay, I'll say it.

I LOVE THE MATRIX!

There, now that I got that out of the way let me explain why I actually
like the third movie as opposed to a majority of society.  I like
Matrix: Revolutions because I'm afraid that if I don't, Agent Smith will
come and take away my geek card.  And I like my geek card. 

Honestly, I when I first saw Matrix: Revolutions I hated it.  I thought
it was filled with HUGE plot holes.  But, after thinking about it, I
realized that they COULDN'T explain it.  As opposed to the first movie,
where everybody involved was quite aware of what the Matrix was, in this
movie nobody involved has any clue what is going on.  If you think about
it from that light, I think you'll find that the movie is quite
enjoyable.
