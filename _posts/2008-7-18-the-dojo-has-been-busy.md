Hey! I knew there was something that I was forgetting to do!  Write in
the blog.

Sorry for the lack of updates lately, but all of us members in the Dojo
have been quite busy.

[Richard](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/richard),
[Ray](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/jez) and I just finished a HUGE data
migration ASP.NET rewrite at work.

[Andy](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/andy) is in the middle of mid-terms.

and there was this little matter of the Cubs playing in October in the
post-season.  See, I'm what people call a Die-Hard Fan.  Season ticket
holder, born and raised on the Chicago Cubs (brainwashed by my wonderful
mother).  I wish there was some pill I could take so I wouldn't give a
damn, but that thought is more of pipe dream than anything.

Hopefully I will have some pictures to post of the craziness that was
Game 6 and Game 7.
