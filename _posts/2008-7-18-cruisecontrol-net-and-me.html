<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The last couple of days at work I've been setting up a continuous integration server using <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET">CruiseControl.NET</a>.  I've found the process to be relatively painless, except for some incidents where reading the docs was the WRONG thing to do.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As an FYI to those out there that, like me, just wanted <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET">CCNET</a> to build their solution using Visual Studio you will run into a bug in the documentation that might make you bang your head against a wall.  The docs will tell you that to setup a Visual Studio Builder in the config file you need to add the following:</font></p> <p><font face="Courier New"><font size="2"><span class="xml-tag"><build type=<span class="xml-quote">"commandLineBuilder"</span>></span><br />     <span class="xml-tag"><solutionFile></span>src\MyProject.sln<span class="xml-tag"></solutionFile></span><br />     <span class="xml-tag"><configuration></span>Debug<span class="xml-tag"></configuration></span><br /> <span class="xml-tag"></build></span></font></font></p> <p><font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span class="xml-tag">Actually, commandLineBuilder is the type you need to pass in if you are using 'make' files.  What you really want to put in there is "devenv".  This will tell <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET">CruiseControl.NET</a> to use Visual Studio.</span></font></font></p>
