Lurking around Code Project today, I stumbled across this article: [.NET
Chaines
Utilitaires](http://www.codeproject.com/Purgatory/stringutils.asp). 

"Hmm, sounds interesting.", I thought.

Followed the the little linky and what did I spy with my two eyes? 

A string utility library written not only in VB.NET but also in French.

I don't know which of those two evils is worse. :)
