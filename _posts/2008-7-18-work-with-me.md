Well, not just me, but [Ray](/jez "My Boss"),
[Richard](/richard "Crazy Canadian"), and a host of others.

The company I work for, Trading Technologies (I refuse to link to the
exceptionally ugly homepage, but google and you shall find), is looking
for a [wonderful, super smart, cool tester guy (or
gal)](/jez/archive/2005/11/30/9501.aspx) to join my team.

This isn’t just any sort of tester position though.  This is a quite
unique position which is why, I think, we are having a hard time filling
it.

Our team is going through some growth (as well as the rest of the
company), and we realize that we need to get some real QA going on our
projects.  Thing is, we don’t have any clue what that means.  We know
what testing is, and we test our code, but I’m not a tester and
[Ray](/jez "My Boss") isn’t a tester and
[Richard](/richard "Crazy Canadian") isn’t a tester or anybody else for
that matter.  So why should we try to create some sort of ultimate
regression test-o-meter with integration carb barrels and unit test wood
paneling when we know we would get it wrong?  So we are looking for
somebody to come in and tell us what we need to do and set it all up. 
This is really a write your own sort of position here folks.  We know
what we need somebody to do, and you tester folks know how to do it, so
why don’t you come to TT and do it for my team?

Please?

Okay.  Fine.

If my cutesy sort of pitch didn’t convince you, maybe you should look at
the real job req here at [our
site](http://jobs-tradingtechnologies.icims.com/tradingtechnologies_jobs/jobs/candidate/job.jsp?jobid=1271&mode=view) and

    yourself some lattes!)
