[Why Does Windows Still
Suck](http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2005/02/04/notes020405.DTL)?

Mark Morford goes off on a rant that Windows sucks because it his SO got
infected with spyware 4 minutes after installing Yahoo! DSL.

Here are some wonderfully ignorant statements:

Comparing Windows to a new car-

> "Here is your brand new car, sir. Drive it off the lot. Yay yay new
> car. Suddenly, new car shuts off. New car barely starts again and then
> only goes about 6 miles per hour and it belches smoke and every
> warning light on the dashboard is blinking on and off and the tires
> are screaming and the heater is blasting your feet and something
> smells like burned hair. You hobble back to the dealer, who only says,
> gosh, sorry, we thought you knew -- that's they way they *all* run.
> Enjoy! "

Actually, if you want to use that analogy it should read something like
this:

> "Here is your brand new car, sir. Drive it off the lot.  Yay yay new
> car. Suddenly, 7000 people come rushing out of nowhere and start
> pelting your car with bricks, beating it with bats, and try to pry the
> hood open with a crowbar.  None of them are very effective however. 
> But this man came walking up, asked if he could install a new radio
> and now the car is filled with cement and on fire.  You go back to the
> dealer, and the dealer asked why you would let a strange man into your
> car to install a new radio?  You answer 'because he asked, and I
> wanted it for free.' At that point the car dealer explains that the
> car was doing a perfectly good job of protecting you from harm, but it
> can't protect you from yourself."

Here is another one:

> "I know of what I speak. I am not a novice. I've been using Macs
> almost daily for 15 years. I am online upward of 10-12 hours a day. I
> run multiple Net-connected programs at all times. I receive upward of
> 500 emails a day, much of it nasty spam that often comes with weird
> indecipherable attachments that try, in vain, to infiltrate my
> machine. My Mac just shrugs them off and keeps working perfectly. I
> dump them all in the trash and never look back."

Could it be that, GASP, the viruses that your Mac simply shrugged off
weren't written to run on a Mac?  Gosh, golly, gee that couldn't be
right.  It must be the fact that the Mac is such a FAR superior
machine!  Two words: [Occam's
Razor](http://www.google.com/search?client=googlet&q=Occam%27s%20Razor).

Oh, oh! Here is a statement that contradicts itself!

> "Which is, of course, mostly bull. I'm no programmer, but I know what

So the Mac OS architecture is robust, and solid, and more difficult to
hack into?  Then why did Apple drop the OS that was so hack proof?  Oh,
you didn't realize that the hacking competition that you reference was
in 1997 and on a machine that can't support OS 10?  The latest OS from
Apple?  The one that is currently on machines?  The one you are
comparing to Window XP?

Grrr.....look, I can take criticism of Windows.  I just can't listen to
close minded zealotry of a platform.  There are reasons to use Apple,
there are reasons to use Windows, and there are reasons to use Linux. 
Learn the reasons, and choose a platform.  Different strokes for
different folks.
