At the office yesterday (at least I think it was yesterday?) we were
conversing about client applications informing web services of their
"preferred" response delivery.  I came away from the conversation a
little skeptical to the entire concept but I decided to do a little
digging into it anyway.  Apparently we aren't the first people to think
of this (are we ever?) and some members of the W3C have already came up
with a specification to handle it.  If your interested in more detail,
surf on over to

I think I am starting to become some sort of services geek. :)
