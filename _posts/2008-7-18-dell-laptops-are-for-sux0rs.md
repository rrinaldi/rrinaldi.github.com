My laptop is very upset with me.  It has decided that it doesn't want to
be a laptop anymore, and that it is quite content with being a
paperweight.  I don't know why it's content being a paperweight, SINCE
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A LAPTOP, but it's happy.  I just can't figure out
why when the fan kicks on the system slows to a crawl. :(  I'm going to
need to start saving money now, papa needs a new laptop.
