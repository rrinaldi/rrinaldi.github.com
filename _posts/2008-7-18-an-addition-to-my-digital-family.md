About a month ago I added a new laptop to my digital family.  My old
Inspiron 8100 is quite close to dead and I've been looking at replacing
it for awhile.  It's still limping and whimpering, but not good for
anything short of being a dumb terminal to my work desktop.

So far the new one has been cool, so I think I will keep him.

Let me introduce to do you, the one and only
