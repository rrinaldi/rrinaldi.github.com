From JK from [jkontherun.com](http://jkontherun.blogs.com/): [Is
Slashdot still
relevant?](http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2005/11/is_slashdot_sti.html)

Slashdot was removed from my aggregator a long time ago.  It’s too far
behind the buzz that already out in the blogosphere and the quality of
the commentary is quite poor.  I really can’t have a conversation with
anybody that has is a zealot or their last opinion of Windows was from
1996.
