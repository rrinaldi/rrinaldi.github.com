If you ever find yourself hankering for some sushi and you happen to be
in Chicago's south loop, I would highly recommend [Oysy
Sushi](http://www.oysysushi.com/) at Michigan and 9th. 
[Richard](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/richard)turned me onto the place
about 6 months ago or so and I've always been very impressed with the
quality of the sushi and the excellent service.  The wonderful part is
that I've been there quite a few times and I've never had to wait for a
table, so I think it is still undiscovered.  I'm hesitant to even talk
about the it because I don't want to wind up waiting for a table the
next time I head over there.  :)
