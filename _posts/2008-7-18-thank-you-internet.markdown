If it wasn't for you, Internet, not only would I be unemployed, I
wouldn't be enjoying this wonderful Cubs game on TV.  It's not that the
Internet is required to watch the tube, but for me to be watching the
game here in Chicago, having a play-by-play conversation with a friend
in Texas on MSN, where he is watching it by streaming it through MLB.com
is quite amazing.  Using the Internet in my day to day life, I sometimes
forget how magically it can be.

Oh yeah, it's a no hitter through 6.  That's cause my guy Clement is up
there.  Keep your fingers crossed. :)
