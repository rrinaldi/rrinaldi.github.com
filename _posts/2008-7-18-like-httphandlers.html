<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Maybe you like HttpHandlers.  Maybe you want to use them to intercept calls to files end users will be downloading from your server.  You want to log the file requests. </font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">"HttpHandlers would be perfect for this!", you smugly think.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Think again.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When deciding to use HttpHandlers, be very, very careful.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At my office, we were using HttpHandlers to track downloads of our products from our customer portal.  So we thought we were being good little developers and we mapped all .zip files in IIS to the ASP.NET dll, setup the HttpHandler paths to only worry about the .zip files in the product downloads section of our site and we went on our merry little way.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A couple weeks go by, and we get an email from our support department.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">"I can't download some log files from the customer portal."</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Interesting.  The log files are just .zip files that customers upload to the customer portal when they open up a support ticket.  So I ask our support guy to forward me the email that has the link to the log files in it, and I'll take a look.  Email comes in, I click on the link, then BAM!</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">"<font color="#ff0000"><strong>Server Unavailable</strong></font>"</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">"HUH!?", I think to myself quite loudly.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That can't be right.  Must have been a quirk.  I'll click the link again and everything will be alright.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">*Click*</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">"<font color="#ff0000"><strong>Server Unavailable</strong></font>"</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">*Gulp*</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At this point in time I start to panic a little. Every time that link is clicked it restarts the ASP.NET worker process.  Kills all of the sessions on the server.  Forcing all of our customers to re-login. Not good.  Not good at all.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I take a look at the Event Viewer.  "ASP.NET worker process stopped unexpectedly."  <sarcasm>Thanks!  That explains it.  I'll just turn off the "Stop Unexpectedly" flag in IIS!</sarcasm></font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So, I figure I'll open up perfmon and see what is going on.  Add a few monitors there, a couple here, and presto.  I click the link in the email and I watch the committed memory skyrocket, then plummet, then the process restart.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">"Interesting.  What could be causing that?", I wonder.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I look at the usual suspect: Norton Antivirus.  Norton has bit me a couple times before, you see.  Before we were using the customer portal to upload log files, customers would email them in.  That was all fine and dandy until you realize that log files have lots and lots of redundant data in them.  Very compressible.  So a 10 meg .zip file turns into 600 megs of extracted text in memory that Norton Antivirus is trying to scan.  Email server reboots, log file email vaporizes into thin air.  Lots of fun all around. :)</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anyway, I turn off Norton and click the link in the email.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">"<font color="#ff0000"><strong>Server Unavailable</strong></font>"</font></p> <p><font><font face="Verdana" size="2">"</font><a href="mailto:*@#!!@!@#$!@$!@#$!@#$!!!!!!!"><font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="2">*@#!!@!@#$!@$!@#$!@#$!!!!!!!</font></a><font face="Verdana" size="2">", I scream loudly in my own skull.</font></font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I start to Google for magical potions and dances I can do that will let people download files off of my server, when I remember the HttpHandlers we have running.  Check web.config and see that the paths the Handlers are handling for have nothing to do with the log file upload directory.  So the handlers aren't running.  Check out IIS and see that .zip is mapped to the ASP.NET dll.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">"Ahhhhh!"</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To make an incredible long and boring story a tad shorter, it seems that when you map a file type in IIS to the ASP.NET dll, ASP.NET will read the file into memory even if there isn't a HttpHandler that will handle it.  When the file is incredible large, this can create problems.  Big problems.</font></p> <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So my advice is to avoid HttpHandlers unless you are really sure they are the solution to the specific problem that you are trying to solve.</font></p> <p> </p>
