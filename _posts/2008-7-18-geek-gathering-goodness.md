My oh my it's been awhile since I posted.  My apologies.  Work has been
nutty and the old personal life was getting kinda crazy.

But, all that changed and now things are wonderful.  Last night I
partook in what has been dubbed "Operation: Chicago Meet-up" and I was
quite surprised by the turnout.  [Jeff](http://weblogs.asp.net/jkey) did
a wonderful job of setting it up and deserves all of the credit (even
though he decided to send some thanks my way).  The evening was filled
with beer, banter, and good times.

I'm looking forward to the next gathering and I'm hoping that even more
people come out. 

If you're interested feel free to contact
[Jeff](http://weblogs.asp.net/jkey/contact.aspx) or
