<p>Some of the new super cool things on the block are Distributed Version Control Systems and being somebody that is into super cool new things I figured I would spend some time and get to know them.</p>
<p>A couple months ago <a href="http://stevenkuhn.net">Steve</a> and I had a hack-a-thon weekend and he introduced me to <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. I have to say that I didn&rsquo;t really like Git.&nbsp; I found it a bit cumbersome and confusing.&nbsp; Honestly, that is probably more my fault than Git&rsquo;s because I had no idea how DVCSs worked and Git is a little to powerful to be put in the hands of a novice.&nbsp; Needless to say handing me Git was like handing me a .45 and pointing it at my foot.&nbsp; It was only a matter of time until I shot myself.</p>
<p>So after blowing off both of my feet and a few other appendages I wrote DVCS off as a bad idea.&nbsp; Luckily <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a> wrote a very awesome <a href="http://hginit.com/">intro to Mercurial</a> that peeked my interest again.&nbsp; Reading the intro filled in a lot of the blanks in my mental model of how DVCS works.&nbsp; I suggest you spend some time reading the intro and then do as I did and go purchase the really awesome <a href="http://tekpub.com/preview/hg">Mastering Mercurial</a> series from TekPub.&nbsp; Once you watch that I think you&rsquo;ll find Mercurial (and Git) a very compelling SCM solution.&nbsp; I found it compelling enough to get a <a href="http://kilnhg.com">Kiln</a> account and try it out on a real honest to goodness (private) project.</p>
