Today is day 3 of our first Sprint. Yesterday was our first Daily Scrum
and so far I’m digging it but I don’t have enough experience to really
know if Scrum “is working” yet.

When we were doing our Sprint Planning meeting it became exceptionally
clear to me that it’s really, really hard to create 4-16 hour tasks when
a lot of a Sprint involves research & prototyping.  We are working on
implementing an [Enterprise Service
Bus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_service_bus) and for this
first Sprint a lot of us have to spend some time just learning the
tooling.  How do you plan tasks effectively when you have no real idea
how long something is going to take?  We wound up actually trying to
plan how we will go about doing our research and how long we will spend
on prototypes but it just feels like those sprint tasks are wild ass
guesses. 

In the future I’m going to advocate that we break the 4-16 hour task
rule when we don’t know the potential solution and use [“Spikes”,
“Tracer Bullets”, and
“Research”](http://www.gettingagile.com/2007/10/22/research-spikes-tracer-bullets-oh-my/)
to wrap our heads around the Product Backlog before we do a Sprint
Planning.
