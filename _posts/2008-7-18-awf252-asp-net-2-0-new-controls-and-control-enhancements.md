To be completely honest with you I have don't have very high hopes for
this one. :(  My notes will only cover things that I haven't already
heard about.

Grrr... Five minutes into the session and Bill Evjen is still
introducing himself.  Get to the code already! ( I know, INETA founder,
wrote 10 books, yada yada yada)
 
This looks like it will be very light on the power point and heavy on
code examples, which makes me quite happy.  That kinda equates to less
notes though, because I have a tendency to look up more and watch the
screen instead of just listening to what the presenter is saying so this
post will probably be a little light. 
 
Oh you probably have also noticed that spelling and grammar are terrible
for the last couple posts.  That's because I'm writing as fast and
furiously as I can so I can try to keep up with the speaker.

The new controls are better organized in VS.NET.
 
HotKey functionality looks cool (didn't ASP.NET already have that?)
 
Literals have a mode attribute that is really cool. Encode, Passthrough,
and Transform. 
-Encode html encodes the text
-Passthrough will output what ever is in the literal (the default)
-Transform removes markup
 
Textboxes have a focus method now.  (yay! /me does a dance \*\\\_O\_/\*
)
 
A new property called AutoCompleteType will read data out of a vcard
that is provided to internet explorer and auto populate fields.  Not
that cool IMHO.
 
ListItem objects now have an enabled property.  Nifty, but I've never
had to enable and disable listitems before.
 
Images now have a DescriptionUrl property.  Chalk one up for
accessibility!
 
Tables have a caption tag.  Don't get the big deal.  It drops a label on
top of the table.
 
Panel has a scroll bar property.  I've always just used CSS to apply
them. \*shrug\*
