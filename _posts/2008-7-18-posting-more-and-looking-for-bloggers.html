<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Up until this point the </FONT><A href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan"><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Geekdojo</FONT></A><FONT face=Verdana size=2> has been primarily focused on .NET and other Microsoft technologies.&nbsp; From now on though, the aggregated blog and it's feed will still remain focused, but the individual bloggers will have freedom to post whatever they feel like.&nbsp; The new version of <a title="" href="http://www.scottwater.com/dottext" >.Text</a> allows a blogger to choose whether or not a post is published to the aggregated site, so now there is no guarantee that you will see every post by every author if you only subscribe to the main feed.</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>When I first started blogging I figured that I would find it easy to stay focused and only write about .NET, C# and various other techie/geeky topics.&nbsp; But as I got more addicted to writing, I found myself holding myself back from writing about other things.&nbsp; So I plan on using this new found freedom to explore other topics and areas of interest.&nbsp; If you care to follow my trip down the rabbit hole make sure you subscribe to my personal feed (</FONT><A href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan/rss.aspx"><FONT face=Verdana size=2>http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan/rss.aspx</FONT></A><FONT face=Verdana size=2>).&nbsp; Hope to see you in wonderland :)</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>On another note, we currently have 10 bloggers here.&nbsp; I would love to see 10 times that amount.&nbsp; If there is anyone out there looking for a place to blog, feel free to contact me.</FONT></P>
