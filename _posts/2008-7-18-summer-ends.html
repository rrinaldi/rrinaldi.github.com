<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>As the Chicago Cubs left the field yesterday, it marked the end of my summer. <FONT face=Verdana size=2>All in all it was quite a good summer.  Watched my boys in blue win some and lose some more, but still manage to have a better record than last year. </FONT> Summer officially ended a couple of weeks ago (Happy Equinox to everybody!), but for me summer extends to the end of the Cubs season and when my involvement with the Special Olympics is over for the year.</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>My real triumph this year was to go to San Bernardino, CA for the Special Olympics Golf National Invitational tournament.  We wound up taking a silver medal in our division, so the trip was definitely a success!  My teammate is a real movie buff so I managed to free up an evening so I could take him to Hollywood.  I have never seen a guy happier!  The glow of his smile still warms my heart. :)</FONT></P> <P><IMG alt="Ray in Hollywood!" hspace=0 src="/images/blogs_geekdojo_net/ryan/222/r_DSC00292.jpg" align=baseline border=0></P> <P> </P>
