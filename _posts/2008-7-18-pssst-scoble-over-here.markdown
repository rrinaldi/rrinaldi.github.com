Hey Mr. Scoble sir, I don't mean to bother you or anything, but I was
wondering if you could take some time and take a look over here:
[http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/teamsystem/blogs/default.aspx](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/teamsystem/blogs/default.aspx)

Check the blogs under the "Development" heading.  Most of them weren't
updated since July!  C'mon man.  I know this isn't your team, and you
probably don't even know these guys but as the defacto MSFT blogging
evangelist you need to light a fire under them and get them blogging!

Thank you. :)
