<p>Good question mister anonymous blog reader guy.</p> <p>On the work front I&rsquo;ve been heads down cranking out the next generation of our super secret internal mega apps.&nbsp; The technologies I&rsquo;ve been digging into the last 6 months or so include (but not limited to): WSE, MSMQ, Windows Services, NUnit, NAnt, CruiseControl.NET and NHibernate.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been a very busy and stressful time to say the least.</p> <p>On the personal front, I&rsquo;ve been keeping myself real busy.&nbsp; 12 weeks ago I started working out with a personal trainer and I&rsquo;ve been hitting the gym quite regularly.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m proud to say that I&rsquo;ve dropped my body fat percentage by 3.5% and I&rsquo;ve dropped about 7 lbs.&nbsp; Until I started working out, I had no idea how out of shape I really was.&nbsp; It was a huge wakeup call the first week I was in the gym.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know that there were so many places on my body that could feel pain. <img src="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan/images/smile1.gif" />&nbsp; Things are a lot better now and I&rsquo;ve become quite a gym rat.</p> <p>Since it is summer, I&rsquo;ve also been working with the Special Olympics again in their Unified Golf program.&nbsp; Once a week I head out to my home town and play 6&ndash;9 holes with my brother&rsquo;s best friend Ray. (For those of you unaware, my brother has Down Syndrome, as does Ray).&nbsp; Ray has been making some great progress this year and with the time I&rsquo;ve been putting into the gym my game has quite improved!&nbsp; This year might be the year that I get to take Ray to State Games.</p> <p>I&rsquo;ve also spent some time lately on non-work related coding (All after hours <a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/jez">Ray</a>, I swear!).&nbsp; In my next post I will be showing off one of the apps I built in my spare time&hellip;Stay tuned!</p>
