(Is jiggy still a cool word? (was it ever?))

[Chicago Nerd Dinner/Geek Meet-up/Drink n’
Eat](http://nerddinner.com/blogs/chicago/archive/2005/08/24/7027.aspx)
is coming up quick! Next week on the 30th at the Rock Bottom Brewery in
glorious downtown Chicago.

If you would like to join me and some fellow developers (folks like
[Jeff Key](http://weblogs.asp.net/jkey/), [Brian Scott](/brian/), [Eric
Bachtal](http://ewbi.blogs.com/develops/), and rumor has it [Dave
Bost](http://www.davebost.com/blog/default.aspx) will be joining us),
send me an email at ryan at ryanrinaldi.com.

Appearances by Jeff, Brian, Eric and Dave are subject to change.  Void
where prohibited by law.  If Jeff, Brian, Eric or Dave don’t make an
appearance, I reserve the right to hire look-a-likes.  If look-a-likes
are unavailable, I reserve the right to hire well trained monkeys.
