<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The <a href="http://www.cnug.org/Default.aspx">Chicago .NET Users Group</a>&nbsp;put together <a href="http://www.cnug.org/Default.aspx?tabid=33">A Day of .NET Conference</a>&nbsp;that took place over the weekend.&nbsp; It seems to be similar to the Code Camps that I keep hearing about.&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the event and&nbsp;the turnout was better than I expected. (I jokingly&nbsp;asked <a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/brian">Brian Scott</a> on the way&nbsp;in to the building "How many people you think will be here?", "6.&nbsp; At most.")&nbsp; The turnout looked to be at least 150 people. (I'm a pretty bad judge of group sizes, but it had to be at least 150)</font></p> <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The tracks for the event&nbsp;seemed to be based around similar topics: Team System and Visual Studio 2005, Office Integration, <font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Arial" size="2">General Code Talks, and Server Side Development.&nbsp; My day started with a great talk on Code Generation by <a href="http://www.dotnetjunkies.com/weblog/knewton">Keenan Newton</a>.&nbsp; He went over the pro's and con's of code generation and dug into the CodeDom a bit.&nbsp; Next&nbsp;I went over to see a talk by Chris "Developer-evangelist-without-a-blog" Mayo on ClickOnce.&nbsp; Chris has a reputation for being a great presenter and he backed that reputation up with another great one.&nbsp; His presentation definitely covered a lot of the questions I had lurking about ClickOnce.&nbsp; (I'm hoping to get the slides so I can pitch it at the office.)&nbsp; After Chris's presentation I took a little break for lunch and chit chatted with <a href="http://blogs.geekdojo.net/brian">Brian</a> about various things (including his work, <a href="http://www.coolsavings.com/">CoolSavings</a>).&nbsp; After the free sack lunch (Turkey.&nbsp; Yum.), I ventured over to <a href="http://blog.magenic.com/keithf/">Keith Franklin</a>'s talk on TDD with Visual Studio.NET 2005.&nbsp; Apparently, Keith forgot to pray to the demo gods.&nbsp; His VS.NET blew up quite spectacularly during his talk.&nbsp; He was able&nbsp;to overcome that minor set-back and plow forward though.&nbsp;</font></font></font></font></p> <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Arial" size="2">After seeing his talk however, I'm a little disappointed in the TDD tooling that is included with VS.NET 2005.&nbsp; I've become quite accustomed to <a href="http://www.testdriven.net/Default.aspx?ReferrerId=3937">TestDriven.NET</a>&nbsp;and the frictionless Code-&gt;Test-&gt;Refactor workflow it has given me.&nbsp; As I'm writing a test, I just right-click, Run Test and Bam!&nbsp; I know if it works.&nbsp; In VS.NET 2005 however, it seems like there are a lot of hoops you have to jump through just to run a single test.&nbsp; First pull up all of tests in your project.&nbsp; Then find the test that you want to run.&nbsp; Check it off.&nbsp; Click the run tests button.&nbsp; Wait for your tests to run.&nbsp; Then double-click your test in the test window to view the results.&nbsp; Seems like a lot of work.</font></font></font></font></p> <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After Keith's talk, I hung around to see <a href="http://davebost.com/blog/">Dave Bost</a>'s talk on the Visual Studio Designers.&nbsp; After watching his presentation, it became pretty obvious to me that I will probably not be using the Team System Architect designers.&nbsp; Way to complicated for the type of work I do.&nbsp; Very neat, but my apps aren't distributed "enough" to make the designers appealing.</font></p> <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For the last talk of the day I saw Compact Framework 2.0 by <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Arial" size="2">Derek Ferguson.&nbsp; Overall it was a good presentation.&nbsp; A little light on the code, and heavy on the concepts which is okay, but I was expecting to see a kick butt app.</font></font></font></p> <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All in all, I tip my cap to the CNUG guys for creating a really great one day conference.&nbsp; Especially since it was no cost to the attendees.&nbsp; I'm definitely going to be going again.</font></p>
