<P>During DevConnections my lifeline to the office was my BlackBerry.&nbsp; It also was my lifeline to keep in touch with the guys from the office that came to Vegas with me.&nbsp; Richard and I had <A href="http://www.blackberry.com/messenger/entry.do">BlackBerry Messenger</A> installed on our BlackBerries and it was a godsend.&nbsp; Ray didn't have BlackBerry Messenger and there was a very big difference in getting in touch with him.&nbsp; Of course I could still email him, and the since BlackBerries have email pushed to them instead of working on a pull model he got the emails fast, but I had no clue when he did.&nbsp; Sometimes email takes longer to get to servers, servers can take long to handle them depending on load, etc.&nbsp; BB Messenger let me know when the message was received and let me know when Richard was writing back (ala MSN Messenger).&nbsp; If you have a BlackBerry, I highly recommend downloading and installing BlackBerry Messenger.</P>
